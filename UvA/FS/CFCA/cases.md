## Individualization -Illicit Drugs
### Case Circumstances:
Person H accuses his friend W of deliberately spiking his cigarette with cocaine in order to create dependency and later sell him more drugs. During the investigation, white powder is recovered from H’s cigarette box. A search of W’s home reveals multiple bags of cocaine, but W claims they are for his personal use and that the powder in H’s cigarette box originated from a party.

### Inference Type:
Individualization — to determine whether the cocaine found in H’s cigarette box can be linked specifically to the cocaine seized from W’s residence.

### Chemical Trace Evidence & Reference Material:
+ Trace: White powder from H’s cigarette box.
+ Reference: Cocaine samples seized at W’s house.
+ splitless GC + full-scan MS + SIM to confirmation/quant
+ Comparison: 
  + Impurity: ecgonine methyl ester, tropacocaine, cinnamoylcocaine, benzoic acid;
  + Cutting agents (levamisole, lidocaine, phenacetin, caffeine, procaine) and their peak-area ratios to cocaine
  + Semi-quant concentration via 6-point calibration (e.g., 0.01–10 µg mL⁻¹)
  + he resulting profile is compared to W’s seized bags with cosine/Pearson similarity and likelihood ratios.
+ Limitation: Interpretation needs reference data/QC and expert evaluation; analysis time and cost are non-trivial.
