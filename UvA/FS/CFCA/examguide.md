+ GC–MS → core for seized drugs, explosives, arson.
+ LC–MS/MS → toxicology, doping, complex drug mixtures
+ GC–FID → fire debris, alcohols, solvents (quant)
+ HPLC–UV / Fluorescence → drugs, pharmaceuticals.
+ TLC–UV/chemical stains → quick field or lab screening.
## Chromatography : GC, HPLC, TLC
### GC: Gas chromatography
+ Separation of volatile compounds by partitioning between stationary phase (column coating) and gas mobile phase (carrier gas)
+ Detect: Volatile and thermally stable organics (e.g., solvents, drugs, accelerants)

### HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography)
+ Separation under high pressure using liquid mobile phase and stationary phase in column.
+ Detect: Non-volatile, thermally labile compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biomolecules).

### TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography)
+ Compounds migrate along stationary phase (silica/alumina plate) by capillary action with liquid mobile phase
+ Organic compounds (semi-qualitative)

## Detection
### FID (Flame Ionization Detector, coupled to GC)
+ Compounds burned in H₂/air flame; ions collected produce current proportional to carbon content
+ Detect: Organic molecules (hydrocarbons, drugs)
+ Sample: Volatile organic residues

### MS / -MS (Mass Spectrometry)
+ Molecules ionized, separated by mass-to-charge ratio
+ Detect: Organic and inorganic molecules, structural details

### UV / Fluorescence detectors
+ UV absorbance (Beer-Lambert law) or fluorescence emission after excitation
+ Chromophores, fluorophores 染料，荧光剂
+ Detection in HPLC/TLC

### IRMS (Isotope Ratio MS)
+ Measures stable isotope ratios (e.g., ^13C/^12C, ^18O/^16O)
+ Isotopic fingerprints
+ Explosive

## C+MS:
### GC–FID:
+ Pros: sensitive for organics
+ Cons: No structural info; cannot distinguish co-eluting compounds; destructive
+ Fire debris (accelerants), volatile drugs, alcohols

### GC-MS:
+ Principle:
  + GC separates volatile/thermally stable compounds based on their partitioning between a stationary phase (capillary column coating) and a mobile gas phase (carrier gas, typically He).
  + MS ionizes the separated compounds (usually electron ionization, 70 eV) and fragments them. The resulting mass-to-charge (m/z) spectrum is compared to reference libraries for identification.
+ Workflow / Features Extracted:
  + Sample is dissolved, extracted, possibly derivatized (e.g., silylation for polar drugs).
  + Chromatogram provides retention time + spectral “fingerprint” for each compound.
  + Can identify active drug, impurities (synthetic by-products), adulterants (levamisole, caffeine), metabolites (toxicology).
  + SIM (Selected Ion Monitoring) improves sensitivity; full-scan gives broader ID.
+ Strengths:
  + “Gold standard” for seized drugs, fire debris, toxicology
  + High selectivity and specificity → structural information from fragmentation.
  + Very low LODs (sub-ng on-column) (LOD:Limit of Detection: The lowest concentration (or amount) of an analyte that can be reliably distinguished from background noise, but not necessarily quantified with precision.)
  + Accepted in court; large spectral libraries available.
+ Limitations:
  + Requires volatile and thermally stable compounds (non-volatiles need derivatization).
  + Expensive instrumentation, requires maintenance and calibration.
  + Matrix interferences can mask low-level peaks.
  + Expert interpretation essential (isomers, co-elution, noise).

## Glass: (LA)-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation ICP-MS)
+ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993612002877
+ Principle:
  + A high-energy laser ablates microscopic material from a solid surface.
  + The aerosol is carried by Ar gas into an ICP torch, where it is ionized at >6000 K.
  + The ions are directed into a mass spectrometer (quadrupole, TOF, or sector field), which measures the elemental and isotopic composition.
+ Workflow / Features Extracted:
  + Allows micro-sampling of glass fragments, paint, metals without total destruction.
  + Provides trace elemental profile (ppm–ppb range)
  + Generates a chemical “signature” of minor and trace elements (Al, Ba, Sr, Ti, rare earths) that can differentiate glass of same type (e.g., car window vs bottle glass).
  + Reference databases or control samples required for comparison.
+ Strengths:
  + Extremely sensitive; can discriminate between visually indistinguishable samples.
  + Non-destructive: minimal material consumed, critical for small forensic traces.
  + Excellent for individualization (linking fragments to a source window/bottle).
  + Also applicable to soils, metals, ceramics.
+ Limitations:
  + Expensive, high-maintenance instrumentation.
  + Matrix effects and calibration challenges (requires matrix-matched standards).
  + Interpretation is complex; multivariate statistics often needed.
  + Requires highly trained operators.

## GSR:
### SEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscopy – Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy)
+ Principle:
  + SEM scans a focused electron beam across a sample surface, producing secondary/backscattered electrons → high-resolution morphology images (down to nm scale).
  + When electrons interact with atoms in the sample, characteristic X-rays are emitted.
  + EDX detects these X-rays and provides elemental composition (qualitative and semi-quantitative).
+ Workflow / Features Extracted:
  + GSR particles collected via adhesive stubs/swabs from hands, clothing, or targets.
  + SEM identifies morphology (spherical or molten droplets)
  + EDX identifies inorganic primer residues (Pb, Ba, Sb, sometimes Cu, Zn).
  + Unique tri-elemental combinations (Pb–Ba–Sb) strongly indicate firearm discharge.
+ Strengths:
  + High specificity for inorganic GSR; distinguishes from environmental particles.
  + Provides both morphological and chemical data
  + Non-destructive; particles can be re-analyzed.
  + Widely accepted in forensic GSR analysis and court testimony.
+ Limitations:
  + Detects only inorganic GSR; cannot detect organic residues (OGSR).
  + Expensive equipment and time-intensive particle search.
  + Background contamination possible (fireworks, brake dust with Ba/Sb)
  + Interpretation requires expertise; not proof of firing, only of possible exposure.


### XRF (X-ray Fluorescence)
+ X-rays excite atoms; secondary (fluorescent) X-rays identify elements
+ Inorganic elements (not as sensitive as SEM-EDX)

## Presumptive tests
+ Presumptive drug tests (e.g., Marquis, Scott, Duquenois-Levine): Color-change reaction with functional groups
+ Presumptive GSR tests (e.g., Paraffin test, sodium rhodizonate): Color reactions with metallic residues
