## Pinhole camera model
+ Pinhole model 小孔成像
  + Captures **pencil** of rays - all rays through a single point
  + the point is called **Center of Projection (focal point)**
  + the image is formed on the Image Plane
+ camera obscura 暗箱
  + image is inverted
  + **depth of the room** is the **focal length**
+ aperture 光圈
  + more clear if shrink the aperture
  + too small: less light, diffraction
+ Projection: world coordinates to image coordinates
