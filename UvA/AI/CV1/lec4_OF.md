# Optical Flow, Tracking
## Optical Flow
+ 2D Motion Field (MF): knows the 3D scene, describe projection of the 3D motion of 3D scene points onto 2D image plane
+ 2D Optical-Flow Field (OF): Describes apparent motion in images, reasoning only in pixel space, does not know the 3D scene

###  Apparent Motion (displacement) of Pixels
+ $I(x,y,t)$ pixe value at time t and location (x,y)
+ $u(x,y), v(x,y)$: horizontal/vertical component
