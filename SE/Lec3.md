# Code review & visual control

## Code review:
+ Code review is a careful study of source code by people who are not the original author of the code
+ like **proofreading** a term paper
+ *Bad smell* code 屎山

### Don't repeat yourself - DRY
+ Duplicared code is a risk to safety
  
### Good code:
+ Write proper comments
+ Use Good Names
+ don't use global variables
