# Agent
+ Pro-active: 主动
+ Reactive: 被动
+ An agent is a (computational) entity that is **situated**位于 in some environment and that is capable of flexible, autonomous activity - action and interaction – in order to meet its design objectives.
+ Other characteristics of agency sometimes claimed to be essential:
  + Rationality 合理行动
  + mobility 灵活性
  + adaptivity (flexibility)
  + introspection 内省：反思 检测错误
  + benevolence 慈善： 考虑他人利益
+ Often mental attitudes are attached to agency, e.g.

### Minimally Intelligent Agent
+ Pro-activeness 主动完成
+ Reactivity: perceive and respond (timely) to the environment
+ Social Ability:
  + cooperation, negotiation,..
  + with other agents and humans
  
### Types of Agent Environments
+ Accessible vs. inaccessible
  + which (level of) information does the agent get about its environment
+ Deterministic vs. non-deterministic
+ Episodic vs. non-episodic
  + independent stages of behavior
+ static vs. dynamic
+ discrete vs. continuous

## Agent Architectures
### Logic Based Agents(LBA) = Symbolic or Knowledge based AI view
+ behavior is influenced by application model, reasoning and deduction is independent.
+ Components:
  + Theory of Agency $\rho$: how do intelligent agents behave in an executable way
  + Belief database $\Delta$:information the agent has about the environment, i.e. facts
  + $\varphi$ represents the actions chosen by the agent
  + $\Delta \vdash_{\rho} \varphi$: that $\varphi$ can be derived from $\Delta$ using the rules of $\rho$
  + Implied action, Allowed action, No action

### Simple Reactive Agents = behavioral, situated
+ result from only thinking/reasoning about and interacting with things.
+ Decision making is established through a set of behaviors
+ Situation -> Action
+ There is a subsumption hierarchy for when multiple behaviors choose conflicting actions

### Model-based Reactive Agent

### Goal-based Agent

## Bold vs. Cautious
+ **Bold** agents never stop to reconsider
+ **Cautious** agents constantly stop to reconsider
