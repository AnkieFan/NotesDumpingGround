# Intelligent Systems

+ Defining Intelligence:
  + Alan Turing: computer program is intelligent if it answers some questions asked by a person in such a way that this person believes that another person responded.
  + Turing wasn’t done yet: supercriticality
  
+ Motivations behind (and requirements on) AI:
  + “visionary”: build artifacts that “produce” intelligent behavior in manner of humans (or animals) 
  + “pragmatic”: build artifacts that show behavior being comparable to human (natural) intelligent behavior 
  + 
+ Knowledge-based AI
  + Guiding model: individual human reasoning capabilities  
  + Guiding assumptions: intelligence is know ledge representation and processing
  + Symbol system hypothesis: ability to produce and manipulate symbols is a necessary and sufficient condition for intelligence
  + Top-down design of intelligence: start with high-level concepts at the knowledge level and break them down into smaller, programmable units
+ Behavior-based AI
  + Guiding model: individual human, individual animal
  + Guiding assumptions: 
    +  intelligence is built upon elementary behavioral activities
    +  senso-motoric coupling is essential
  +  Physical grounding hypothesis: rooting of symbols in the real world is a necessary condition for intelligence
  +  Bottom-up design of intelligence: related to the field known as Artificial Life (concerned with creating computational artifacts that deserve to be called alive)
+ Connectionism; Artificial neural networks
  + Guiding model: (human) brain
  + Guiding assumption: processing of information through very simple but many interconnected units (neurons) that interact at a low (signal-processing) level
  + Key characteristics: parallel, distributed and sub-symbolic information processing
+ Distributed AI
  +  Guiding model: group of humans, human society
  +  Guiding assumptions:- intelligent beings do interact, to act together is characteristic to intelligent beings “no intelligence without interaction”
  +  in contrast to connectionism, the interacting units operate on the knowledge (rather than the signal) level
  +  Key issues: communication, coordination, cooperation, negotiation, organization(al structure), etc.
