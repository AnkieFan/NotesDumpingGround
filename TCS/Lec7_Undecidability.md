# Undecidability
$A_{TM} = \{<M,x>: \text{M on input x accpets}\}$  
Universal Turing Machine (UTM): when run on $<M,w>$, it simulates the computation of M on input w: $UTM(<M,x>) = M(x)$

## UTM
+ Assume that 𝑴 halts on input 𝒘 within 𝑻 steps. Then, the simulation of 𝑴 on input 𝒘 by 𝑼𝑻𝑴 takes at most 𝑻𝐥𝐨𝐠𝑻 steps.
