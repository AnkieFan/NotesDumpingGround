## Research and Requirements Extraction
### Related work
### Requirements Extraction
### Low-fidelity Prototype

## Hard-coded Prototype
+ Description of the hard coded task,
  + include key screens related to the hard coded task, and an explanation
+ Link to the prototype (make sure a manual is included in the appendix)  

...  
The result screen: old and new(changed because of the primary stage user test)  

## Test Designing and Running
### Test Designing
The principle and how we test it

### Test Running
#### Primary Test
+ users: librarians
+ interviews
+ specific feedback, change of low-fi prototype and then hard-coded one

#### User Test
+ Describe how your users were chosen (criteria you followed in sampling, target population, possible sources of bias)
+ how user tests were run (prototype link + google form)
+ the exact targets/metrics and conclusions you had planned to derive from your tests ( see assignment description for possible questionnaires you may want to use ).
+ Relate your targets/metrics and expected conclusions to usability principles
+ experienced emotions

## Test Results and Analysis
+ Repeat assumption, questionnaire structure.  
  + Do the two groups differ significantly regarding the features measured in (b) and the emotions experienced in (c)?
### 1st part
can users use this app smoothly
### 2nd part
properties of learnability
### Emotions model

## Conclusions
