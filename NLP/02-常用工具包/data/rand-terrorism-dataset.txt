The kidnappers took Elbrick from his car and left a ransom note demanding the release of 15 prisoners who were to be flown to Algeria, Chile, or Mexico, and the publication of an antigovernment manifesto.  The kidnappers negotiated with the government by notes.On September 5, the government agreed to release the prisoners and authorized Brazilian newspapers to publish the manifesto.  The deal was almost upset at the final moment when paratroopers in Rio de Janeiro attempted to prevent the plane carrying the prisoners from taking off.  The paratroopers were ordered back to their barracks, however, and the plane left for Mexico on September 6.  Ambassador Elbrick was released on September 7.Following the episode, Brazilian authorities initiated a roundup of leftist suspects, arresting as many as 4,000.  This was the first of the diplomatic kidnappings, a practice that spread rapidly throughout Latin America in the next few years.

ARGENTINA.  Members of the FAL kidnapped Joaquin Waldemar Sanchez, the Paraguayan consul in the border town of Ituzaingo.  They threatened to kill Sanchez and begin killing the managers of American business firms if two of their members being held by the Argentine government were not released from prison.The government rejected their demand, stating that one of the two was not in custody and that the other would stay in jail because he was a common criminal who was in the hands of the judicial branch of the government and it would violate the Argentine constitution for the executive branch to interfere in the judicial branch.  President Stroessner of Paraguay, who was vacationing in Argentina at the time, fully concurred in the government's position.The kidnappers extended their deadline several times.  The government displayed one of the prisoners on television to show that he had not been tortured or killed, but refused to release him.  On March 28, the kidnappers released Sanchez unharmed, for humanitarian reasons, but vowed to execute police and government officials.  Argentina thus became the first government to successfully defy a group of kidnappers, establishing a precedent which Guatemala would follow a few days later on March 3l.
ARGENTINA.  Four members of MANO attempted to kidnap Yuri Pivovarov, Soviet assistant commercial attache.  Pivovarov was taken from his car at gunpoint and forced into another car.

When the kidnappers' car collided with another car and smashed into a tree, three of the kidnappers were captured and the fourth escaped. Pivovarov was not seriously injured.  A subsequent investigation revealed that a deputy federal police inspector was involved in the attempt.  MANO had threatened to kill the Soviet Ambassador and his family just two days before in retaliation for the kidnapping of the Paraguayan consul on 24 March.
GUATEMALA.  Members of the FAR kidnapped Count Karl von Spreti, West German ambassador to Guatemala, who was taken from his car at gunpoint and driven to a hideout outside of Guatemala City.  The kidnappers threatened to execute Count von Spreti unless the government released 17 prisoners.  The demand was later increased to the release of 25 prisoners and the payment of $700,000 ransom.In the face of strong pressure from the West German government, and in contrast to its previous prompt accessions to kidnappers' demands (March 6, 1970), the Guatemalan government rejected the demands, citing the Argentine precedent (March 24, 1970) and the Guatemalan constitution which prevented the executive branch from interfering with the judicial branch of the government.Behind the public show of resistance was a private conviction on the part of officials within the Guatemalan government, including the president, that the kidnappers' deadline had been extended and that a compromise settlement was possible.  A last-minute attempt at negotiations failed, however, and on April 5 authorities received an anonymous phone call telling them where to find the ambassador's body. The West German government denounced the Guatemalan government and reduced its diplomatic representation in Guatemala to a bare minimum.

URUGUAY.  Aloisio Mares Gomide, Brazilian consul, was kidnapped by Tupamaros the same day as Mitrione (see July 31 above).  The Tupamaros said they chose Dias Gomide because he was the representative of a dictatorship which had tortured and killed hundreds of Brazilian patriots.  Dias Gomide and two other hostages were being held in return for the release of some 150 imprisoned Tupamaros, but the Tupamaros later reduced their ransom demand for Dias Gomide to $250,000.  The ransom money was raised by the consul's wife, but some reports indicate that it was never paid.  Dias Gomide was finally released over six months later on February 21, 1971.
UNITED STATES.  A Pan American World Airways 747 jumbo jet was hijacked to Cuba by a 35-year-old Puerto Rican nationalist, Rudolfo Rivera Rios.

When the aircraft landed, the Cuban authorities jailed the hijacker for seven years.  When Rios returned to the United States in 1978, he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping.

A Swissair DC-8 enroute from Zurich was hijacked to Dawson Field in Jordan.   A Pan American World Airways 747 from Amsterdam was first ordered flown to Beirut, then to Cairo, where it was blown up a few minutes after the passengers and crew were evacuated.   A TWA 707 en route from Frankfurt was forced to Dawson Field, a landing strip in the Jordanian desert described by the hijackers as the Revolution Airport.A fourth hijacking of an El Al Israel Airlines plane en route to London from Amsterdam was foiled when a security guard aboard the plane killed one of the hijackers and wounded another.  The dead hijacker was Patrick Arguello, a member of the FSLN, a leftist guerrilla movement in Nicaragua.  The wounded hijacker was Leila Khaled, who had participated in the hijacking of a TWA 707 to Syria on August 29, 1969.  Miss Khaled was arrested in London but later released to gain release of the hostages in Jordan.The PFLP announced that the hijackings were in retaliation for American support of Israel and the U.S.  peace initiatives in the Middle East.  The hijackers demanded the release of Arab guerrillas imprisoned in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.  West Germany at first agreed to release the prisoners, but later reversed its position in favor of a joint international effort to free the passengers.On September 9, the PFLP hijacked a BOAC VC-10 from Bombay, India and also had it flown to Dawson Field in Jordan, bringing the total number of hostages held in the desert to 300.  Negotiations to free them were complicated by the outbreak of fighting between Jordanian troops and Palestinian guerrillas.  On September 12, the remaining passengers (women and children had been removed earlier) were evacuated and the three planes were blown up.  Most of the passengers were soon released, but the PFLP continued to hold 58 hostages in order to exert pressure on the European governments.  The hostages were released on September 25, 26 and 29.  On September 29, the Swiss government announced that the British, Swiss and West German governments would free seven Arab guerrillas when the last six hostages, who were US citizens, had left Jordan.  The seven prisoners were released and flown to Cairo on September 30.  Twenty-five persons who were held hostage for 22 days reached a combined $370,000 out-of-court settlement with Trans World Airlines whose 707 jet was one of the planes hijacked.  Awards in the settlement ranged from $17,500 for a single person to a combined $80,000 for a six-member family.  The attorney for the plaintiffs said, It is one of the first cases where an airline accepted responsibility for recovery for mental anguish (suffered by passengers) in hijacking cases.

CANADA.  Members of the Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ) kidnapped James R. Cross, British trade commissioner in Quebec Province, and demanded as ransom the release of 13 imprisoned FLQ members and their flight to Algeria or Cuba, the publication of the FLQ manifesto, the payment of $500,000 in gold, the publication of the name of the informant whose tip had led police to raid an FLQ hideout in June, and the reinstatement of certain post office workers who had lost their jobs.  The Canadian government rejected the demands but attempted (unsuccessfully) to communicate with the kidnappers.FLQ members kidnapped Pierre LaPorte, minister of labor in the Quebec government.  The kidnappers warned that they would kill LaPorte if the demands made by Cross's kidnappers were not met.  The government again rejected the demands, but offered the kidnappers a safe conduct out of the country if the two hostages were released unharmed.  On October 16, the federal government of Canada invoked emergency powers which authorized police and troops to conduct searches and make arrests without warrants.  On October 18, LaPorte's body was found in the trunk of a car.  In a massive hunt for the kidnappers, more than 500 suspected members and sympathizers of the FLQ were arrested.  Three were later convicted.On December 3, James Cross's kidnappers dropped all of their previous demands and released him unharmed in return for safe conduct to Cuba. On December 28, 1971, LaPorte's kidnappers were arrested.  They were subsequently tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. In December 1978, a French-Canadian couple ended their self-exile in France to face trial in Montreal for the kidnapping of Cross.  They refused to plead to the charges in a preliminary hearing.  The judge entered a plea of not guilty on their behalf.  On August 7, 1979, Jacques and Louise Cossette-Trudel received two-year jail sentences for the kidnapping.  Jacques Lanctot, brother of Louise Cossette-Trudel, was given a longer sentence because he refused to express regret for his actions when he pleaded guilty.On June 9, 1982, Yves Langlois, the last of the five Quebec separatist guerrillas wanted for the kidnapping of James Cross, returned home to Montreal from exile in France.  He pleaded guilty to forcible detention, extortion and conspiracy.  In September 1982, Langlois was sentenced to one day less than two years and was ordered to do 150 hours of community work after his release.

Jorge Born was released on June 20, after the corporation agreed to pay the ransom.  Most of it was paid in cash, which the Montoneros said they would use to buy arms and build a popular organization.The Argentine government opposed the payment, which they noted equaled one-third of the country's national defense budget, and most of the negotiations had to be carried on in Europe.  Argentine police attempted to intercept $1.2 million in food and clothing which Bunge and Born had agreed to distribute in slum areas as part of the ransom. Later, two executives of the company were arrested by Argentine police.
ARGENTINA.  General Carlos Prats Gonzalez, former commander of the Chilean Army under the late President Salvador Allende, and his wife were killed in a bomb blast as they drove toward their Buenos Aires home.  (The General had gone into voluntary exile in Argentina after the 1973 coup in Santiago.) Suspicion immediately fell on a right-wing terrorist group that calls itself the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance.  However, the possibility that Chileans might have been behind the bombing has not been ruled out.
ITALY.  Four terrorists invaded Face-Standard in Milan, a local ITT communications subsidiary, and set fire to a warehouse, causing about $9 million damage.  The same evening, the Avis Milan offices were bombed, with damage reported to be about $15,000.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.  Four Palestinian terrorists hijacked a British Airways VC-10 jet from Dubai within the UAE and forced it to fly to Tunis after a refueling stop in Tripoli, Libya.  An Indian stewardess was shot in the back during a shootout on the plane, but her wound was not serious.  In addition to the hijackers, the plane carried 22 passengers, 13 crew members, and 12 ground-service employees who had been aboard the aircraft when it was seized.  The hijackers demanded that Egypt release 13 Palestinian guerrillas imprisoned in Cairo. (Eight had been convicted by Sudan for the slaying of three diplomats in Khartoum on March 1, 1973, and five were awaiting trial by the PLO for the December 17, 1973, attack on the Rome airport.) The demands were at first rejected by both the government of Egypt and the PLO.The hijackers released four passengers on November 22.  Thirteen more were released after the five terrorists involved in the Rome Airport raid were freed by Egypt and flown to Tunis.  Two other Palestinian guerrillas held by The Netherlands were also released at the hijackers' demand and were flown to Tunis.  The seven released Palestinian prisoners then boarded the plane.The hijackers shot and killed a West German hostage, Werner Gustav Kehl, on November 23, but the remaining hostages were released on November 25.  The hijackers then demanded asylum in Tunisia.  The Tunisian government agreed to their demands and the gunmen and the seven Palestinians surrendered to Tunisian authorities on November 25.On November 27, the PLO announced that it had arrested 26 persons in Lebanon and other Arab countries for their alleged involvement in the hijacking and that it would try the suspects in public.  On December 7, the Tunisian government handed over the 11 terrorists (the four hijackers and the seven other guerrillas who had been released from Cairo and The Netherlands) to the PLO.  They left Tunis in PLO custody for an undisclosed destination.  The four who hijacked the plane have been tried and sentenced, according to a January 24, 1975 PLO announcement.  The sentences were believed to be long prison terms.  Their actual whereabouts, however, remain a mystery.

LEBANON.  An Air India B0747 flying 155 passengers on the Bombay-Beirut-Rome-New York run was hijacked out of Beirut by Josef Homolov, a Czechoslovak-born Canadian who entered the cockpit and flashed a pocketknife.  While holding a flashlight over the pilot's head, he demanded a gun and passage to a place of his choice.  During the two hour seige, he attempted to force the pilot to put the plane into a sharp dive over the center of Rome.  At this point the hijacker was overpowered by members of the crew.  He was arrested by Italian authorities after landing in Rome.
FRANCE.  The Baader Solidarity Group, Holger Meins Brigade and Ulrike Meinhof Commando claimed credit for attacking the Mercedes branch in Paris, near the Etoile.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  Two armed men and a woman kidnapped Peter Lorenz, the Christian Democratic Union Party candidate for mayor.  The trio ambushed Lorenz's chauffeur-driven car as he was en route to his office in Berlin.  A truck suddenly blocked the path of the car as it approached an intersection.  A woman in another car rammed the limousine from the rear, and another car drove up to block an escape route from the side.  Lorenz's driver, who jumped from the car, was thrown to the pavement and beaten unconscious.  The female kidnapper was later identified as a fugitive anarchist linked to the Baader-Meinhof band of urban guerrillas.  The Movement of June 2 claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.  The kidnappers freed Peter Lorenz on March 4 after government authorities released five convicted anarchists from West German prisons and flew them, plus a hostage, out of Frankfurt airport for an unknown destination.  A sixth prisoner whose release was requested, refused to join the group.  The prisoners were also given $50,000.  Other demands met by the government included the release of two persons jailed for their role in violent demonstrations in November 1974 after the death of an imprisoned urban guerrilla leader.  Three members of the terrorist band were arrested by authorities six months later.  They were identified as members of the inner circle of the Movement of June 2.  The Lufthansa jet carrying the prisoners and hostage landed March 3 in Aden, Southern Yemen.  After the Aden government granted amnesty to the five, the hostage flew back to West Berlin on March 4 and appeared on television to read a statement from the anarchists.  The note said the South Yemen Foreign Ministry had assured the anarchists the right to stay in full freedom and without limitation in Aden.  The statement also contained an apparent code signaling that the kidnappers were safe and that Lorenz should be released.  Lorenz was released on March 4.ADDINFO:  This episode has been included as an act of international terrorism because the sovereignty of West Berlin still resides in the occupying powers, not West Germany.
On March 5, two boats filled with 8 Palestinian militants landed on the coast of Israel, proceeded on foot to Tel Aviv, and stormed the Savoy Hotel. The original target of the attack was reportedly the Tel Aviv Municipality Youth Center. However, the militants encountered several policemen on their way to the Youth Center. While fleeing the policemen, the militants climbed over an embankment, to the road, and seized the Savoy Hotel, the only lighted building on the street.  The militants took the guests and employees hostage and reportedly demanded a plane to Syria with which to leave with their hostages. They also demanded that the French, Greek, Vatican, or UN ambassador be brought in as a guarantor of the deal and had pamphlets demanding the release of ten prisoners, including the Greek Catholic Archbishop of Jerusalem, Most Rev. Hillarion Capucci, in jail for arms smuggling. They later reduced their demand to safe passage for themselves. On the morning of March 6, Israeli troops stormed the Hotel and ended the stand-off. Eighteen people; eight civilian hostages, three Israeli soldiers, and seven gunmen were killed in the attack. Two of the police officers killed were killed as the militants entered the hotel. At least twelve people; six civilians and six soldiers, were injured in the attack. The attack occurred on the eve of a visit by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to the Middle East to assist in peace negotiations.  Al-Fatah claimed responsibility for the attack.  They stated that the attack was intended to serve as notice to the Israeli government and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that there could be no Middle East peace settlement with the Palestinians. Some Fatah militants were saying that the attack originated in Egypt, not Lebanon, though sources reported that this was an attempt to undermine Anwar SadatÕs government (which they were distrustful of) in the upcoming Kissinger meetings. The statement claiming responsibility also reported that the commandos had blown themselves up when they ran out of ammunition. It was unclear if this was true.  On March 6, officials reported that they had captured the ship (which was carrying the two small boats) used to drop off the militants. It is believed the terrorists began their trip in Lebanon.
TURKEY.  A packet of explosives was hurled into the garden of the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul, only partially exploding.  No damage was caused.  The Mahir Cayan Suicide Group claimed responsibility.

FRANCE.  A special French police captain, two members of his squad, and Michael Moukarbel, a Lebanese guerrilla who was under arrest, were killed in the Latin Quarter near the Sorbonne in Paris by a man called Carlos. Mr.  Moukarbel had been arrested for taking part in the bazooka attack at Orly Airport last January.  The search for Carlos led to inquiries in 10 countries.  The incident gradually brought out a story of international terrorism and links among extremist groups of Palestinians, Germans, Japanese, Turks, and possibly others.  It served to connect a series of attacks and bombings in several countries over the last few years.  Speculation has it that Carlos, later identified as Ilich Ramirez Sanchez of Venezuela, might be the key to terrorist international, a group linking apparently separate terrorist causes in one grand conspiracy.  The evidence uncovered in Paris showed that there were ties of logistics, weapons, help in faking documents and finding refuge and probably exchange of information.
ETHIOPIA.  Kidnappers seized two Americans, Steven C.  Campbell and James J. Harrell, both civilian technicians, at the U.S.-run Kagnew military communications relay station in Asmara.  The two worked for Collins International Service Company, Richardson, Texas, a subsidiary of Rockwell Corporation.  The ELF claimed responsibility.  Conflicting reports have the abductors also as the Popular Liberation Front, another Eritrean independence group, whose goal is Eritrean secession from Ethiopia.  The Eritrean rebels demanded from the U.S. government:  halt arms supplies to Ethiopia's military regime and close U.S.  communication bases there; compensation for areas of Eritrea that suffered heavy damage in attacks by the U.S.-equipped Ethiopian Air Force planes during fighting between rebels and Ethiopian government forces; U.S.  government pressure on Ethiopia's military government to free all Eritrean rebels it holds in prisons.

Swedish charge d'affaires Frederick Bergenstrahle and his secretary were also seized.  Seizure of the consular section of the U.S.  embassy in downtown Kuala Lumpur resulted in an original capture of 53 hostages, then a smaller group of 15 hostages being held captive for 79 hours.  The hostages were released August 7 after Japan had met the demands:  In return for the hostages, the gunmen forced Japan to agree to releasing seven Red Army comrades from prison.  Two of the seven preferred to remain in Japan, but the other five were flown to Kuala Lumpur and then went on with the gunmen to Libya.  Also aboard were a Japanese crew of nine and four government officials--two Malaysians and two Japanese--presented as hostages in exchange for those seized during the embassy occupation.  As a financial footnote in siege operations, Japan Airlines stated that the cost of the Boeing and crew to take the Red Army men to Libya was $618,000.  The terrorists gave themselves up to Libyan officials.ADDINFO FF:  August 4, 52 hostages.  The guerrillas freed the hostages in exchange for release of 5 other Red Army men imprisoned in Japan. They had stormed 12 story bldg, making their way to American consulate on 9th floor.

Ten countries were solicited for asylum and most refused permission to land.  Negotiations stalled at the airport over Red Army demands to carry explosives with them and that their route to Libya be over water to bypass Israel, but the terrorists finally gave up the bombs, although they were allowed to keep their guns.  The plane finally landed in Tripoli.  Red Army gunmen expressed solidarity with Palestinian movement and with new Communist governments of South Vietnam and Cambodia.
COLOMBIA.  Donald E. Cooper, vice president for merchandising for the Sears, Roebuck department stores in Colombia, was kidnapped from his Bogota home by five men and one woman.  Wounded in the ambush were two household employees.  No ransom was demanded.  Mr. Cooper's kidnapping marked the first time that a U.S. citizen had been the direct target of an abduction in Colombia.  A number of wealthy Colombians and occasionally foreigners have been kidnapped by guerrillas over the years, but not U.S.  citizens.  Colombia authorities believed that left-wing guerrillas were involved.  Cooper was released on November 2, 1975.ADDINFO:  The police said it was not known if the kidnappers were common criminals after money or urban guerrillas seeking to publicize their struggle against imperialism.

The attack was believed to have been planned to coincide with the Ethiopian government celebration of the anniversary of the overthrow of former Emperor Haile Selassi and the 13th anniversary of the integration of Eritrea into Ethiopia.  The servicemen were released in Sudan on January 9, 1976, in good condition.  The State Department said no ransom had been paid nor concessions made, but refused to discuss the details of the release while other Americans were being held.ADDINFO:  Spokesman for the ELF in Beirut demanded through the press that the United States cease all military aid to the Government of Ethiopia, close the communication facility near Asmara, dismantle an Ethiopian naval base under construction at Massawa, pay compensation for damage done to Eritrean villages by the U.S.-equipped Ethiopian Air Force, and exert pressure on the Ethiopian government to free all Eritrean rebels it holds in prisons.  Deadline was set for October 3.
SPAIN.  Five armed Arab terrorists forced their way into the Egyptian embassy in Madrid, threatening to blow it up and kill the ambassador and two aides.  The guerrillas demanded that Egypt refrain from signing implementation documents for the interim accord with Israel; that it issue a public declaration by officials attending the implementation conference in Geneva that the agreement signed September 4 was a betrayal of the Egyptian and Arab peoples; and that the Egyptians leave the Geneva meeting.  Speculation was that the PLFP may have been involved.  The ambassadors to Algeria and Iraq volunteered to serve as hostages along with three Egyptians.  The terrorists, their three Egyptian hostages, and the Iraqi and Algerian ambassadors were driven to the airport on September 16 where they boarded a four- engine, Soviet-made plane for flight to Algeria.  The guerrillas released the hostages in Algeria and surrendered to Algerian authorities, who turned them over to the PLO representative.ADDINFO FF:  Guerrillas threatened to blow up Egyptian embassy with Ambassador Mahmoud Abdul Ghaffar and his two aides unless Cairo renounced Sinai pact with Israel.

THE NETHERLANDS.  Seven armed extremists, calling themselves the Free South Moluccan Youths and demanding independence for the Indonesian Island of South Molucca, seized a passenger train near Beilen in Northern Netherlands, killing at least three men and taking about 64 hostages.  Twenty-six of the original 64 hostages either escaped or were released, leaving a total of 38 hostages on the Beilen train.

KENYA.  Three Palestinian terrorists, apparently members of the PFLP, were arrested by authorities at Nairobi's Embakasi International Airport before they could fire their SAM-7 heat-seeking missiles at an EL AL plane scheduled to stop over during its flight from Johannesburg, South Africa, to Tel Aviv.  Some reports claim that the machine guns, grenades, pistols and SAM-7s were provided by Idi Amin of neighboring Uganda.  A few days later, West Germans connected with the Baader-Meinhof Gang were sent to find out what had happened to their colleagues but were also arrested, apparently as a result of a tip by Israeli intelligence to the Kenya Security Service.  The female German had instructions written on her stomach in invisible ink ordering the terrorists to carry out their attack.  The release of the terrorists was demanded by a PFLP group that hijacked an Air France plane to Entebbe, Uganda on June 27, 1976.  The Palestinians were held in Israeli jails until February 1980 when they were sentenced to 18-year prison terms.

A previously unknown group calling itself the Organization of the Sons of Southern Lebanon claimed responsibility.  The group said the target had been a party of Israeli military officers supposedly boarding the plane.  The attack was made in France to remind France of its colonial past. One of the gunmen was tentatively identified as Mahmud Awada, a Lebanese member of a clandestine leftist organization, who headed a squad that murdered Francis Meloy, Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, and his econonic counselor, Robert Waring, in 1976 during the Lebanese civil war.

After a 10-hour siege, the gunmen (one a Chicago resident and the other an out-of-towner) released the hostages.  Bilandzic is said to be the founder of an alleged terrorist organization called the Croatian People's Resistance whose aim is the independence of Croatia from Yugoslavia.  On December 2, Bozo Kelava, 36, and Mile Kodzoman, 32, were acquitted of kidnap charges, but were convicted on a lesser charge of imprisoning West German Vice Consul Werner Ickstadt after seizing the consulate.

At the same time they kidnapped Japanese Takakasu Suzuki, sales manager of a textile company jointly financed by Salvadoran and Japanese capital.  The kidnappers demanded money, the publication of manifestos in newspapers in El Salvador and the rest of the world, and the release of five political prisoners in El Salvador.

The youths said they belonged to the United Popular Action Front.  They also demanded an accounting of the 108 persons they said had disappeared, a euphemism for persons who may have been killed after they were picked up by plainclothesmen of El Salvador's harsh military regime.  They also demanded the lifting of a year-old Public Order Law that gave police wide-ranging authority to put down public demonstrations and political activities.

AFGHANISTAN.  The U.S.  Ambassador to Afghanistan, Adolph Dubs, was abducted by a group of Afghans described as right-wing Moslem terrorists and then shot to death.  It was uncertain whether Mr.  Dubs was killed by his abductors, as they had threatened, or was shot when government security aides rushed into the hotel where he was being held and opened fire.  According to American Embassy sources, the government force rushed the building in spite of a warning from the American Embassy in Kabul not to attack the hotel or open fire on the abductors while efforts were being made to obtain the Ambassador's release peacefully.  After the shooting, Mr.  Dubs was found dead of gunshot wounds in the head and heart.  Three of the abductors were killed in the shootout, and one was captured.  The kidnappers were believed to be seeking the release of three recently imprisoned Moslem religious leaders.  Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed shock at the Soviet actions while advising police in Kabul, blaming the Soviets for failure to heed the U.S.  repeated requests that the assault not be undertaken.  The Afghan government claimed that it was a regrettable but unavoidable response to terrorists.  The affair left many unanswered questions:  the number and identify of the abductors, their motive, and a missing .22 caliber that fired several shots.

Both ambassadors, Michel Dondenne of France and Julio Esquivel of Costa Rica, were among the hostages.  By May 7, safe conduct out of the country was being offered the rebels if they would release the hostages.  Costa Rica's ambassador escaped with four women while his captors were eating dinner.

BELGIUM.  General Alexander Haig, scheduled to retire in four days as NATO Supreme Commander in Europe, escaped a terrorist bombing.  The bomb was aimed at Haig's car as it crossed a small bridge enroute to his office.  Guards traveling in a second car were slightly injured. The bridge, not far from Brussels, was wired with a land mine with a command-detonated device.  Apparently the would-be assassins were off on their timing because the land mine exploded between the two cars. Haig's car was only slightly damaged; the chase car was totally destroyed but its occupants received only minor injuries.  In July, the Andreas Baader Commando of the Red Army Faction (RAF), explained the failure of its attempted assassination in a letter to LE SOIR: We made a technical error; the general's car was traveling at a speed of 2 meters per tenth of a second and this was the time it took to manually detonate the 20 kg. of explosives.  As a result, the explosion occurred between the general's car and that of the escort following it.

McDonald was general manager of the company's Salvadoran subsidiary, Aplar; Bucheli was an engineer.  The slain driver, Jose Luis Paz Tartara, was shot when he tried to resist.  The Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers claimed responsibility for the kidnapping; the terrorists demanded that the Beckman Electronics Company run ads in Central American, European, and U.S. papers calling for a leftist overthrow of the government of El Salvador. The ads were in clumsy English poorly translated from Spanish; they illustrated photos of bloody bodies while the text condemned bestial sadism by the government of El Salvador and says the executives were kidnapped as representatives of a fundamental enemy of the Central American revolution, the North American imperialst. The Americans were released November 7, 1979, after a reported $10 million ransom was paid and two-page ads appeared in the October 11 Los Angeles Times and New York Times calling for a popular insurrection and liberation war against the government of El Salvador.  The ads, signed by the Central American Workers' Revolutionary Party, also appeared in Central American and European newspapers.  Fred Rayne, the negotiator and security advisor for Beckman stated that the terrorists were very cooperative and appeared to be a group of young students dedicated to a cause.

The 28-year-old hijacker demanded that the passengers be exchanged at Tunis Airport in Tunisia for 25 jailed union leaders who, he said, must also be given their jobs back.  He had seized the plane midway through its scheduled flight from Rome to Tunis.  However, the Tripoli airport where he wanted the flight diverted was closed due to a sand storm; the Maltese authorities refused landing at Malta which resulted in a final landing at Palermo where, after a stalemate, the hijacker surrendered to Italian authorities.
SPAIN.  Responsibility for bomb attacks against airline offices in Madrid has been claimed by a Commando for Justice for the Genocide of Armenians. The same Armenian group claimed responsibility for a number of attacks last year in Madrid, Rome, Paris.  Bomb attacks occurred at TWA (several injuries), British Airways, Swissair, and Sabena (Belgian).
IRAQ.  A Lebanese man hijacked a Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 with 137 people on board.  The jet was enroute from Baghdad, Iraq to Beirut.  The hijacker used a kitchen knife.  The hijacker demanded that a press conference be held at the Beirut airport.  He surrendered to security agents when the plane landed.  There were no injuries. The hijacker said at the press conference:  I want the Islamic foreign ministers conference to clear the mystery that surrounds the disappearance of Iman Mousa Sadr. A number of other hijackings were related to the same disappearance.
LEBANON.  Three Lebanese, armed with pistols and hand grenades, were arrested at the Beirut airport as they tried to board an Air France plane during an attempted hijacking.

The New Armenian Resistance claimed responsibility for both bombings in a communique to a press agency.
EL SALVADOR.  Leftist militants took over the Spanish embassy in San Salvador, holding the ambassador, Victor Sanchez-Mesa y Juste, and eleven hostages.  During negotiations the leftists later released four.  The February 28 Popular Leagues said they were demanding an investigation of alleged human rights violations by the Red Cross and the Organization of American States as well as a break in relations between Spain and other democratic governments and El Salvador's repressive regime.  They also called for the release of other leftists imprisoned in Salvadoran jails.  The takeover sparked threats of reprisals from right-wing groups who said they would burn the Spanish Embassy in a replay of an attack by police on the Spanish Mission in Guatemala City the previous week in which 39 people were killed.  On February 11, a spokesman said, if they don't release our comrades or tell us where their bodies are buried, we will be here for months. The Leagues were demanding the release of three Leagues leaders and two members of the leftist Popular Revolutionary Bloc, another of El Salvador's powerful leftist alliances.  The siege ended on the 18th of February when the government allegedly acceded to the demands for the release of prisoners.
EL SALVADOR.  A group of leftist militants seized the Panamanian Embassy in San Salvador for the second time in a month, taking three hostages, including the Panamanian Ambassador.

TURKEY.  The home of two U.S. Embassy counselors was bombed in Ankara.  There was some damage but no one was hurt.
ITALY.  The Secret Armenian Army for the Liberation of Armenia claimed credit for a bomb in Rome that damaged the offices of El Al. An anonymous telephone caller later told the Rome office of the U.S.  Associated Press that the bombs were set off at 1) Swissair as a warning that it must not repeat its mistake and jail innocent Armenian citizens, 2) Lufthansa as a punishment for the German government which helps Turkish fascism..., and 3) El Al because of its role of Zionism....
SPAIN.  An Arab attacker, apparently seeking to kill a Jewish leader, mistakenly killed a Spanish lawyer.  The police arrested a suspect, Said Ali Salman, 27, for the submachine gun attack.  He was carrying a photo of Max Mazin, president of the Spanish branch of B'nai B'rith , who lived in the same apartment building as the lawyer and looks like him.
ITALY.  Armenians claimed credit for two bombs at Turkish Airlines in Rome's Piazza della Repubblica, killing two and injuring 12. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Armenian Secret Army. A second bomb was calculated to kill or wound the curious who came to watch after the first bomb went off.  A telephoned warning was later received warning against Turkish fascism and Italian imperialism which ignore the Armenian cause.
UNITED STATES.  In New York, a fire caused by an incendiary bomb extensively damaged the Angolan Mission to the United Nations. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by Omega 7, an anti-Castro Cuban group that has greatly escalated its terrorist attacks over the past winter against the Soviet and Cuban UN missions and related targets.
UNITED STATES.  According to Cuban officials, an explosive device was placed under the limousine of Cuba's U.N.  Ambassador Raul Roa Kouri in an effort to assassinate him.  It was located and later defused. An anonymous phone call to UPI claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing for Omega 7.  On October 2, 1982, three men were arrested in New Jersey and one in Miami, Florida, by FBI agents, who had spent over two years investigating the incident.  A fifth man is being sought.  The government men are under court order not to discuss the case.  The men involved are Andre Garcia and Alberto Perez, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, Eduardo Losado-Fernandez of Newark, New Jersey, and Pedro Remon of Miami, Florida.  The complaint charged all five men with transporting explosives from New Jersey to New York.  If convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  An informant who was an accomplice in the transportation of the explosives had provided the information to the FBI.

The caller said, Our only aim is to strike against Turkish personalities and Turkish institutions all over the world.
ITALY.  Another Libyan businessman, Abdul Aref, was shot to death in the fashionable Cafe de Paris, in Rome.

YUGOSLAVIA.  In Belgrade, a bombing attack was made on the PLO liaison office in which a vehicle parked outside the office was demolished and three occupants believed to be PLO operatives were injured.
UNITED KINGDOM.  Six armed Iranians took over the Iranian Embassy in London and held 26 hostages for nearly six days.  Three of the hostages were British; the remaining were Iranian diplomats and staff with some foreign visitors.  Police cordoned off the embassy and tried patiently to negotiate with the gunmen through the embassy windows and by telephone.  The gunmen were from Khuzistan, the oil-producing province of Iran on the southern border with Iraq.  They claimed to be members of the Group of the Martyrs and were demanding autonomy for their province in addition to the release of 91 prisoners being held in Khuzistan.  They wanted the prisoners flown to London and then safe passage guaranteed for all, including the hostages, out of the country.  They pledged to not harm non-Iranian hostages and apologized for the trouble they were causing London.  They wanted to deal with the Khomeini government but got little response.  Iran sent an open letter to the gunmen refusing their demands and stating that the Khuzistan prisoners would be executed if any of the embassy staff came to harm.  Bani-Sadr said his government is ready to accept the martyrdom of our children in England rather than submit to blackmail.During the course of the negotiations the gunmen released 5 hostages at separate times.  On the 5th of May, shots were heard and a dead hostage was dumped out the front door of the embassy.  The gunmen informed police that they would kill an additional hostage every 30 minutes until their demands were met--those demands being now simply safe passage out of the country. Authorities immediately sent into action their one plan in reserve. Commandos of the Army's anti- terrorist unit of the Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) stormed the embassy, killing five terrorists and rescuing 19 hostages.  When the black-garbed commandos entered by lowering themselves by ropes from the roof and crawling in windows the gunmen panicked and opened fire on their hostages, wounding several and killing one.   Explosions caused by stun-grenades used by the commandos to disorient the terrorists and catch them by surprise, quickly spread flames through the building and eventually gutted the embassy.  As the hostages were rushed out of the building to safety, their identities were checked.  Mistaken at first for a hostage, one of the gunmen, Fowzi Nejad, 23, was discovered and arrested.  Nicknamed Baby Face by the hostages, he was called a good boy by some of the Iranians but nevertheless was packed off to jail.  Later, in January of 1981, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
COLOMBIA.  Unidentified persons attempted to burn down the Venezuelan Consulate during the night.  They set fire to the main entrance and then fled when they were discovered.  There was minor damage. Security has been tightened.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  Omran el-Mehdawi, former secretary for economics and finance in Libya's West German embassy, was shot and killed by a pistol-wielding gunman who said he worked for the Libyan Information office.  The captured gunman stated he did it for non-payment of a personal debt since 1975.  However, it was in 1975 that the Libyan government announced it would nationalize all industries.  El-Mehdawi was one of many Libyan businessmen who fled Libya in 1975, taking their funds with them to Europe, thus incurring the wrath of Qaddafi.
EL SALVADOR.  U.S.  Marines and American Ambassador Robert White's bodyguards used tear gas and a bulletproof truck to break a siege of White's residence in San Salvador by Salvadoran rightists.  The Marines and bodyguards lobbed tear gas canisters to scatter about 30 rightists.  No one was injured.  The rightists accused White of being a Communist and demanded that he pressure the government to release the jailed leader (Major Roberto d'Abuisson) of an attempted right-wing coup.  Hundreds of demonstrators announced they would continue to lay siege to the U.S.  embassy until the United States orders his withdrawal.  The demonstrators accuse Ambassador White of meddling too much in Salvadoran internal affairs.
ITALY.  A Libyan restaurant owner in Rome escaped an attempt on his life.  Salem Mohammed Fezzani, a naturalized Italian citizen, was shot at by another Libyan, Monsur Mezaroni Belgozem, who dined in the restaurant with two other Libyans.  Three shots missed and the assailant was captured by police while trying to flee.  Under police questioning, Belgazem said he was sent by the people to kill Fezzani. Libyan citizens have been killed recently in Britain, West Germany, and Greece.
TURKEY.  The Turkish-Iraqi pipeline near Kayri village was bombed by Kurdish militants who, when captured in early 1982 claimed that they been sent by the Kurdish National Unity Party leader Jalal Talabani in Syria.  The pipeline carries Iraqi oil from Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Iskenderun.  The two Kurds arrested were allegedly responsible for a similar bombing of the pipeline in May 1979.
ITALY.  Two Arabic-speaking gunmen walked into the Iraqi Embassy in Rome, pulled their weapons and ordered an embassy chauffeur to call Iraqi consular officials.  As the chauffeur began phoning, one of the gunmen bolted and began shooting, then was wounded by a guard.  His partner seemed to lose control, shot and killed the chauffeur, and escaped through a side entrance.  The assailants who shouted Viva Khomeini as they fired, left a brown leather suitcase containing a time bomb when they fled.  The bomb was deactivated by police experts three minutes before it was set to go off.At first police sources thought the assailants were Iranians and that the incident was part of the continuing hostility between Iran and Iraq.  But later they reported that the one wounded gunmen who was captured, claimed they were both Iraqi.  In Beirut, Lebanon, news organizations received telephone calls from a man who said an anti-Government Iraqi militant group known as Iraq's Mujahedeen Islam was responsible for the attack.
UNITED STATES.  A powerful bomb ripped through the Washington, D.C., home of Yugoslavia's charge d'affaires, Vladimir Sindjelic.  The bomb had been placed in a window box outside their sitting room.  No one was injured although there was a great deal of internal and external damage.  A group of Croatian nationalists (Croatian Freedom Fighters) claimed full responsibility for the act which they said, in a letter mailed to the Washington Post, was a sign of protest against the Yugoslav government and its treatment of the Croatian movement's supporters.  Croatian terrorists have been involved since 1971 in a series of assassination attempts in various countries ranging from West Germany to Paraguay.  At least 50 persons have died since 1972 in various acts of terrorism instigated by Croatians or their supporters.
LIBYA.  A mob of demonstrators attacked and set fire to the British Embassy while the staff was inside.  However, no injuries were reported and there was little damage to the building.  The attack seemed provoked by the expulsion of Libya's Chief of Mission from England.
COLOMBIA.  Two people were shot and wounded when alleged guerrillas unsuccessfully attempted to kidnap Kenneth H.  Reysen, manager of the Colgate-Palmolive Company.  Six heavily armed men surprised Reysen as he was leaving his home.  His chauffeur, the watchman at his home, and several policemen engaged the attackers in gunfire, forcing them to flee.  The watchman was wounded, as was one of the guerrillas.
SOVIET UNION.  A group of expatriate Iranians attempted to set fire to the Iranian Consulate in Baku, near the Iranian border.  The Iranians were demanding to return to their homeland.

On the same day in France another bombing was claimed by this Committee. (See France, August 7, l980) (LE MONDE, 8/9/80)
LEBANON.  U.S.  Ambassador John Gunther Dean escaped unharmed after gunmen in a speeding automobile attacked his bulletproof limousine as he was leaving his Hazmieh residence in a convoy.  The ensuing battle between the ambassador's bodyguards and the gunmen left the embassy car demolished on the passenger side, glass shattered, and tires flat.  Two Lebanese suspected of being linked to the assassination attempt were taken into custody for questioning.  The attack came just hours after Dean said the United States was working with Israel and the United Nations to end the violence among Christian militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas in southern Lebanon.  Dean had also created an uproar in August when he condemned an Israeli raid on Palestinian guerrilla strongholds in the area. Responsibility for the attack was later claimed by the Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners, a shadowy right-wing group.
EL SALVADOR.  The Guatemalan Embassy was the scene of a shootout between policemen guarding the embassy and members of the People's Liberation Front (FPL).  There were no casualties.
EL SALVADOR.  Eighteen leftist guerrillas led by a woman shot their way into the Organization of American States local offices, killing a guard, seizing the building and taking eleven hostages to demand an end to Salvadoran government repression against leftist sympathizers. They also demanded the release of political prisoners.  Government troops in tanks ringed the mission and then pulled back to allow negotiations to take place.  The guerrillas were members of the Revolutionary Democratic Front.  The hostages included the OAS delegate from Nicaragua, as well as 10 other diplomats and OAS employees.  On the fifth day negotiations started with a representative of the OAS from Washington.  On the 10th day an OAS assistant director was released due to his cardiac condition.  On the 11th day, September 28, the leftists freed the remaining hostages.

PHILIPPINES.  Several hotels, including the Peninsula Hotel, the Marlim Mansion Hotel, the Century Park Sheraton, and the Philippine Plaza, were bombed in a terrorist attack by the April 6 Liberation Movement, which is calling for the overthrow of the regime of President Ferdinand E.  Marcos. The bombing appeared to be part of a campaign to discourage foreign tourism in which four luxury hotels were attacked and at least 7 people were injured.  The April 6 group, in a statement, said the bombings were to  inform Mr.  Marcos that he can no longer control the people's anger and to serve notice to all foreign tourists not to travel to the Philippines.
SPAIN.  In Madrid, the office of Alitalia was bombed by a group calling itself the Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia.  Although physical damage was minimal, 12 persons were injured.  The bomb exploded at a time calculated to injure a large number of people.
LEBANON.  A bomb directed at a Swiss business exploded in the predominantly Muslim section of west Beirut.  The October Third Organization claimed responsibility.
UNITED KINGDOM.  A Turkish Airlines office was bombed in London causing damage but no injuries.  An unidentified caller said a group called the Armenian Secret Army was responsible.  The caller said the bomb was meant to protest the Turkish goverment's bloody action against Kurds and Armenians.  The bombing might also have been related to bombings in Hollywood, Paris, and an almost simultaneous one in London.  Scotland Yard said that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the two London bombings were not related.
FRANCE.  A Swiss Tourist Office in Paris was bombed causing damage but no injuries.  This was the second bombing in two days aimed at Swiss buildings and possibly the fourth related to bombings in which the Organization of October 3rd, an Armenian terrorist group, claimed responsibility.
PHILIPPINES.  A bombing of a convention of the American Society of Travel Agents in Manilla injured 20 people, 7 of whom were Americans. The bomb exploded during a movie which started directly after President Fedinand Marcos gave the opening address.  Marcos and the American Ambassador, who was sitting nearby, were not among those injured.  The bombing led to the issuing of an arrest warrant for 30 people who Marcos claimed were involved in a plot to destabilize the country through the use of terrorism.  The arrest warrant was issued based on evidence given by a Philippines born American named Victor Burns Lovely who as a member of an anti-martial law terrorist group, was severely injured while assembling a bomb in September.  He had since turned state's witness.  The list of thirty names included some prominent political figures in the Philippines, including a former senator.  The senator, who had been injured in a terrorist attack in 1971, denied any involvement in the bombing.  Thirteen people believed responsible were sentenced on February 11, 1982, to four to six months in jail but the judge said they would be freed in two weeks because they had alredy been held more than a year.  One of those sentenced was Doris Nuval Baffrey, 28, a U.S. resident.

ITALY.  Two bombings, one at a Swiss Airlines office, and one at a Swiss Tourist bureau, injured 5 people in Rome, Italy.  The bombings were first claimed by the October Third Group which said it was protesting Swiss and Italian fascism.  However, in a call to Agence France-Presse, the Armenian Secret Liberation Army and the Turkish Kurdish Worker's Party claimed responsibility.  They said that while they regretted injury to innocent people, there would be more attacks against private and public establishments in Turkey because of growing opposition to the government and in Switzerland because it locks up our militants.
ITALY.  In Rome, the offices of the Turkish Airlines were damaged when a powerful bomb exploded.  The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia claimed responsibility for the incident in a call to the Rome office of AP shortly after the explosion.
FRANCE.  Three men machine-gunned a cafe in Hendaye on the French side of the Spanish border, killing two and wounding 10.  The cafe is regularly frequented by E.T.A.  members, which may have prompted the attack.  The three men took off in their car and broke through a nearby frontier post in Spain.  Across the border, they were held briefly by police and then released before French authorities could even obtain their identities, despite urgent phone calls from France. A presumption is that the three men had connections with the Spanish police, and were, in fact, sent on police business.
GUATEMALA.  The Uruguayan embassy in Guatemala City was bombed.  The People's Guerrilla Army, the EGP, claimed responsibility.
FRANCE.  An employee of the Swiss consulate in Marseille discovered a time bomb upon arriving for work.  The consulate was unoccupied due to the early hour.  A police bomb expert defused the bomb before it exploded.  The bomb was made of sticks of dynamite activated by a sophisticated electronic igniter, but the timer apparently malfunctioned. The Armenian terrorist group the Third of October is believed responsible.
UNITED STATES.  Washington, D. C.  An unexploded bomb was discovered at the Palestine Information Office (PIO), the PLO's unofficial embassy, after UPI received a letter in Hebrew taking credit for an expected explosion on behalf of a previously unknown group, Hatikva Leumi (Hope of the Nation).
PERU.  Unknown persons made two dynamite attacks against the Chinese Embassy.  There was some damage but no injuries.  There have been several other dynamite attacks in the country; about 100 have occurred since July.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  A former Israeli officer and aide de camp of General Moshe Dayan during the fight for Israeli Independence, Shlomo Levin, was shot to death in his home in Erlangen, near Nuremberg.  Also killed was his companion Frida Poshke.  Since moving to West Germany in 1960, Lewin had become a leader of Nuremberg's Jewish community.  Investigators ruled out robbery and said the killers could probably be found among the enemies of Israel and were politically motivated.
GUADELOUPE. A bomb planted in an airport luggage locker at Point-a-Pitre exploded a few hours before vacationing French President D'Estang and his family were to pass through.  The bomb injured one Chilean tourist and a cleaner, and caused considerable damage.  The attack was attributed to the Armed Liberation Group of Guadeloupe (GLA), which is believed to have strong ties to Cuba.
SPAIN.  A newspaper reporter was said to be in serious condition after a bomb planted in a telephone booth he was using exploded and blew off both his legs.  The man had come to the scene to investigate an explosion at the Swissair airline office which had taken place shortly before, and was using the phone booth to report to his newspaper.  The second bomb was directed at the TWA airline office.  The two explosions were claimed by the October Third group, an Armenian organization, in a phone call to the press. The caller termed the attacks retaliation for a scheme planned by American intelligence against a defense lawyer for Armenians who was assaulted in Geneva several days ago.  A total of seven people were injured in the attacks.
CYPRUS.  A car bomb explosion in Limassol maimed Hamid Hindi, 52, a Syrian editor and publisher who once served briefly in his nation's Cabinet.  Police arrested a man with a Canadian passport as a suspect. He had been seen loitering suspiciously outside Hindi's home a few hours before the explosion.  Authorities identified the suspect as Moshe Antoine Bavli, an Israeli of French origin and a Swiss resident. There is speculation in the press that he is in reality an Israeli agent, avenging the New Year's Eve bombing of the Jewish-owned hotel in Nairobi, Kenya.  The Kenyan government had accused a Moroccan citizen who was also a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and it is presumed that the car bombing was a swift move by the Israeli secret service to attack that organization. Hindi, during his time in the Syrian cabinet, was considered one of the founders of the PFLP.
FRANCE.  A bomb exploded in the car of Ahmet Erdeyli, the financial adviser of the Turkish Embassy in Paris.  He escaped without injury. An investigation by French officials showed that the explosion was caused by a hand grenade placed under the front fender of the car. The Alex Yenikomeshian Commando of the Armenian Secret Army claimed reponsibility for the attack (Armenia - stated that diplomat was heavily wounded.)
UNITED STATES.  San Francisco, California.  A bomb exploded at an Iranian bank in San Francisco, shattering windows and damaging the wall of the building where the explosive was planted.  No injuries were reported at the Bank Melli Iran and no arrests were made.  A caller from the the Jewish Defense League claimed credit for the attack, stating that it was in protest for the persecution of Iranian Jewry. Later a man called the media claiming that the American Revenge Committee, formed to take revenge against Iran for the treatment of the former hostages, was responsible.  The caller claimed the group would continue bombing Iranian targets and threatened to kill Khomeini supporters.  FBI investigators took the threats seriously because the caller gave certain authenticators indicating intimate knowledge of the bombing.
UNITED STATES.  Los Angeles, California.  Los Angeles police dismantled a bomb discovered on the doorstep of the Swiss consulate. A man with a foreign accent had called the Associated Press earlier and warned there was a bomb in the building.  Ninety minutes later he called again identifying himself as Operation Three, and stating, We don't want to explode it ...  they have to release our friend. The editor of an Armenian newspaper published in Los Angeles said it evidently was linked to the case of an Armenian nationalist being held by Swiss authorities as a suspected terrorist bomber.  An Armenian group calling itself October 3 has claimed responsibility for the bombing of a number of Swiss government and commercial buildings throughout Europe in recent months.  The group has been seeking the release of Alex Yenikomeshian, who was with a Canoga Park woman in a Geneva hotel when a bomb they were apparently assembling went off, injuring the woman.  The woman, identified as Suzy Mahseredjian, was released by a Swiss court and allowed to return to the United States after she was accused of affiliation with the Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia. In November, 1987, Vicken Tcharkhutian admitted in federal court that he had built the weapons used in this attack.  Tcharkhutian is a member of ASALA.
FRANCE.  Three mail bombs, postmarked from Spain, exploded in the homes of three Romanian dissidents, a writer, a former interior minister, and an engineer.  The exiled Romanians, writer Paul Goma, former minister Nicolas Penescu, and engineer, Serbran Orasco, each received a package containing two books by former Soviet premier Khrushchev, to which explosive devices were wired.  Goma was suspicious, threw his package into the bathroom and called the police.  A bomb-detonating expert touched the package whereupon it exploded; he received slight hand injuries.  Penescu was seriously injured in an identical attack and was taken to the hospital with face, hand, and torso injuries.  He is a member of the National Romanian Council in Exile.  Orasco, in Cologne, opened his identical package and received mild injuries when it exploded.The packages were undeniably from the same source.  In addition, the three Romanians had all attended the Conference on Security and Cooperation recently held in Madrid.  Presumably, they had been targeted there during a press conference they held afterwards.  All three of them were known for their exposure of human rights violations in their home country.  Goma stated that he had received numerous death threats in Romanian since his exile three years ago.  He believed the bombs to be the work of the Romanian secret police.  French police authorities say that in their opinion the bombs were not meant to kill but to intimidate.
LEBANON.  An armed attack on an official car of the Iraqi embassy in Beirut was claimed by Eagles of the Revolution.
FRANCE.  The embassy of South Yemen in Paris was blasted by two rockets which were set in launchers with timers and fired from the courtyard of a neighboring apartment house.  The perpetrators claimed to represent the victims of a bomb attack on a Paris synagogue in October 1980.  An anonymous telephone call, pamphlets found near the embassy, and the words Remember Copernic daubed on a nearby wall showed that the raid was intended as a reprisal for the death of four persons in that bomb blast on the Rue Copernic.  South Yemen was implicated because the one man linked to the affair was traced to an alleged Palestinian training camp in that country.  In Aden, the Marxist government accused agents of imperialism and Zionism for the attack and demanded that the French government apprehend those responsible.  The blast tore into the first floor of the embassy, causing serious structural damage.
SPAIN.  In a bid for national attention, three commando groups of hooded Basque guerrillas kidnapped three honorary consuls from their homes in northern Spain.  The three men abducted were representatives of Austria, Uruguay and El Salvador.  In reaction to the alleged torture death by police of a jailed Basque terrorist suspect, ETA/PM, the political-military wing of Basque Fatherland and Liberty, demanded that various sectors of the media should publicize an Amnesty International report on alleged police torture of prisoners in Spain, a report by the Human Rights Commission of the Basque Parliament on alleged mistreatment of prisoners by police and 18 photos of the separatist guerrilla allegedly tortured to death by police in Madrid.  One week later and just five days after the attempted rightist military coup in the Spanish Parliament, the guerrillas released the consuls and declared a cease-fire in its fight against the Spanish government in order to allow political forces to work out problems in the region.  The moderate political wing of the ETA said it was asking the ETA military wing to go along with the moratorium on terrorism.  It was not clear whether the separatists released the hostages because they felt their demands had been satisfied or because of the coup attempt.
LEBANON.  Unidentified gunmen fired grenades at the U.S. embassy in a coordinated attack against the Sudanese, U.S. and Egyptian embassies.  Egyptian president Anwar Sadat had just taken part in a meeting the day before with Sudanese president Gaafar Nimeiri, and had made his first move towards rejoining Arab ranks since the Arab-Israeli peace treaty.  There were no injuries.
PAKISTAN.  Three armed hijackers seized a Pakistani International Boeing 720 while it was on a flight between Karachi and Peshawar, near the border of Soviet-occupied Afghanistan.  They were believed to be members of Al Zulfikar, a group of pro-Bhutto extremists.  Zia ul-Haq, presently in power in Pakistan, became president after toppling Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was executed in 1979.The hijackers held 141 people as hostage, including three Americans, two U.S.  residents, and 11 crew members.  The hijackers demanded that Pakistan release at least 70 political prisoners and relatives of leftists or there would be serious consequences.  They threatened to kill the passengers one by one and blow up the plane.  The plane landed in Kabul, Afghanistan, where one diplomat, Tariq Rahim, was shot and his body dumped unceremoniously on the runway.  The shooting took place during a beating incident and may not have been premeditated.  Rahim was Pakistan's diplomat to Teheran.  He was a former aide to Bhutto and suspected of complicity in the 1977 coup that installed Zia as president.  The leader of the hijackers, a Pakistani identified later as Salamullah Khan, said he was prepared to release the women and children if the government of Pakistan would apologize publicly for saying that he belonged to the outlawed Pakistan People's Party.  Twenty nine hostages--women, children and sick men--were released on March 7 in Kabul.Without warning, the plane with more than 100 hostages still on board flew to Damascus, Syria, on March 9 where the terrorists reopened negotiations with Syrian officials and Pakistan's ambassador to Syria. Pakistani officials had agreed to release only 20 political prisoners. On March 12, the Pakistani government agreed to release 55 prisoners; Libya agreed to receive the hijackers and the released prisoners.  In addition, the hijackers also asked for $50,000.  The Pakistanis quickly agreed to that demand.  The leader of the hijackers also asked that a few members of their families be allowed to stay behind in Pakistan to sell any family houses or land, with a promise from Islamabad government that they would be allowed to leave Pakistan freely once their holdings had been liquidated.  Once again, the Pakistanis agreed.The Pakistani prisoners were rounded up and put on a plane headed for Libya.  Enroute, however, Libya inexplicably reversed its original acceptance of the hijackers.  On March 15, after a 13-day siege, Syria agreed to give them asylum with their political prisoners.  The hijackers surrendered as the plane returning from Libya with the 54 political prisoners (one could not be located) was flown to Syria.  There, the hostages were released unharmed.  The hijackers surrendered to Syrian authorities.The admitted victory for the three hijackers brought a storm of criticism from the US and Pakistan for the part played in the negotiations by the Soviets and Afghanistan.  Some officials suggested that the Soviets' lack of action could have been from the fact that the hijackers, political foes of Zia, were almost certainly supported by the Soviet-installed  regime of Karmal in Kabul.   This assessment ascertained that not only did the Kabul regime  support the hijackers' aims, but may have smuggled automatic weapons aboard the aircraft when it was in Kabul.   Hostages later reported they arrived with pistols and left with machine guns.
LEBANON.  Three gunmen in a speeding car and using silencers on their weapons shot and killed an Iranian student leader as he walked on a Beirut street.  Mohammad Saleh, president of the Iranian Student Association, was the second president of the Association to be killed since the beginning of the Iranian-Iraqi war.
COSTA RICA.  A civil guard discovered an unexploded grenade at the residence of the Nicaraguan ambassador, Dr.  Javier Chamorro Mora.
COSTA RICA.  Terrorists launched rockets from a speeding car at a U.S. government van carrying marines to guard duty at the American Embassy in San Jose.  Three marines and two other persons were injured.  The Commander Carlos Aguero Echeverria Command, named for a Costa Rican who died fighting alongside Nicaragua's Sandinist guerrillas against the Somoza regime, claimed responsibility and called the latest attacks reprisals against American and Honduran support for El Salvador's civilian-military junta. In late April, three of the terrorists were arrested.  They belong to the Costa Rican group called the People's Avant-Garde Organization. The organization is at least two years old and is made up of commando groups independent of each other.
EL SALVADOR.  More than a dozen men in three groups attacked the U.S. Embassy building with machine gun fire and self-propelled grenades, but no one was injured.  Two groups of men each fired on the building from opposite ends as a diversionary tactic while a third group fired a Chinese-made rocket-propelled grenade which damaged the building severely.  The clandestine People's Liberation Forces (FPL) claimed credit for the attack with the purpose of repudiating the United States' direct intervention in the Salvadoran conflict.  The charge d'affaires, Frank Chapin, was not in the embassy.  He has been the highest ranking diplomat in El Salvador since President Reagan removed Ambassador Robert White from the office.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  A bomb exploded at a U.S. Army security office in Giessen, 35 miles north of Frankfurt, causing about $50,000 damage.  No one was reported injured.  Letters claiming responsibility for the attack linked the incidents with supporters of jailed members of the Red Army Faction who were staging a hunger strike at the time for improved prison conditions.
LEBANON.  The French Embassy in Beirut was attacked by rockets during the night.  The Mujaheddin Saff (The Warriors) claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was to protest France's sale of Mirage jets to Iraq, with whom the Iranians are warring.
GREECE.  Firebombs exploded under four automobiles belonging to Americans assigned to the U.S.  Air Force facility at Athens airport. The bombs were placed under vehicles in four different residential areas of the city.  There were no casualties, only material damage.
EL SALVADOR.  The U.S.  Embassy was attacked by unidentified individuals for the sixth time in the past month.  Eyewitnesses near the embassy reported that guerrillas fired heavy-caliber weapons at the building for several minutes.  Embassy security forces pursued the attackers and presumably wounded one of the guerrillas.
GUATEMALA.  The Japanese Embassy in Guatemala City was attacked by unidentified gunmen.  The embassy was vacant save for police guards on duty.
GUATEMALA.  For the second time in a month guerrillas have attacked the French oil-drilling company in Rubelsalto owned by ELF Aquitaine. Saboteurs planted and detonated explosives at the pipeline used to transport the pumped crude oil.  The company is carrying out the necessary repairs to reestablish normal production.
FRANCE.  A previously unknown group, the Jewish group Pessach (Passover) claimed responsibility for shots fired during the night at the Syrian Airlines office in central Paris.  In a telephoned statement to AFP, Pessach stated that the attack was a reply to Syrian persecutions of Jews and the massacre of Christians in Libya.  The movement also claimed responsibility for shots fired a week earlier at an extreme right-wing bookshop also in central Paris.  There were no casualties reported in either incident.  On May 13, three members of the Pessah group were arrested.  They claimed the attack on the bookshop was motivated by a recent desecration of a Jewish cemetery in France.  The three were traced through the licence plate number of their car, taken down by a passer-by.
ITALY.  Pope John Paul II was shot and seriously wounded as he drove through crowds gathered for his weekly public audience in St.  Peter's Square in Vatican City.  Police arrested an escaped Turkish terrorist who was identified as Mehmet Ali Agca, 23.  Two women standing by were injured, one seriously.  The Pope recovered from his wounds after two operations. The assailant apparently hoped to strike at Soviet and U.S. imperialism but the connection to the Pope was not made clear.  He escaped from a Turkish prison shortly before the Pope arrived in Turkey in 1979 where he had made death threats against the Pope.  He had been convicted of the assassination of a prominent Turkish editor in the wave of terrorism that subsequently led to a military takeover, and had been sentenced to death.In July 1981, after a three-day trial, Agca was sentenced to life imprisonment by an Italian court in Rome.  The first year of that sentence was to be spent in solitary confinement.  When read the sentence in his jail cell because he had boycotted the court proceedings on the grounds that the Italian courts could not prosecute him for a crime committed in the Vatican, Agca showed no sign of emotion and told his Italian lawyer that he did not wish to appeal.  He will be eligible to be freed after serving 28 years of his life sentence.  Contrary to the hopes of many, the speedy trial did not serve to answer the questions of motive, and whether Agca had acted alone or had been part of a conspiracy in the assassination attempt.  The court had refused to admit any psychiatric evidence but the overriding impression of Agca was of a fanatic, though as one Turkish journalist stated, Agca likes to play the fanatic, but he's not really like that at all.   High-ranking Turkish officials are convinced that Agca did not act alone but have not been able to identify any accomplices.On August 10, 1982, Italian authorities were expected to file charges against several people suspected of helping Mehmet Ali Agca in his assassination attempt.  Investigators were expected to go to Switzerland and then possibly West Germany, Austria, and Spain to gather information.  Authorities would give no details but said they are continuing to investigate links between Agca, who is Turkish, and a gun-smuggling ring operating in Bulgaria and Turkey.  On November 25, 1982, Serge Ivanov Antonov, an employee of the Bulgarian national airline and tourist office in Rome, was arrested and charged with complicity in the shooting.  There have been no indications of an international plot.  The Bulgarian Communist government demanded the release of the suspect stating that his arrest was groundless and a hostile act against Soviet-aligned Bulgaria.  However, Italian authorities content there were two other gunmen in St. Peter's Square ready to shoot the Pope; Antonov's companion has not been identified.In September 1996 the Turkish gunman made a plea to Italy asking to be pardoned from his life sentence there and to be moved to a prison in Turkey.
UNITED STATES.  New York.  Another mid-Manhattan office building was evacuated while police removed a bomb from the Honduran Consulate.  The bomb had been mailed and was defused when suspicious employees called authorities.  The nine-inch pipe bomb was similar to three discovered at Pan American World Airways.  Authorities suspect the same group called the Puerto Rican Armed Resistance.
TURKEY.  Four leftist gunmen hijacked a Turkish Airlines DC-9 en route from Istanbul to Ankara as it left Yesilkoy International Airport.  They ordered the pilot to land at the small military airfield at Burgas in Bulgaria. The hijackers demanded $500,000 and freedom for 47 prisoners in Turkish jails.  They threatened to kill five American banking executives among the 112 passengers aboard and also to blow up the plane if their demands were not met.  Twenty-five women, children, and men with chronic ailments were allowed to leave the plane at Burgas, a resort city on the Black Sea, leaving 91 passengers still in the plane, plus a crew of six.  The Turkish government refused to negotiate and asked Bulgaria to keep the plane from leaving Burgas.Two passengers escaped by jumping from the plane through an emergency exit. Bulgarian officials maintained contact with the hijackers by radio.  The hijackers threatened to kill the five American passengers if their demands were not met by a specified time.  This deadline was extended, then finally abandoned.  The hijackers then asked for 200 envelopes and a quantity of paper so that the hostages could write farewell letters.  The Turkish government continued to refuse to accede to the demands of the terrorists and threatened to execute the 47 jailed leftists if the hijackers carried out their threat to blow up the plane.Twenty-four hours later, on May 25, a dramatic end came to the hijacking. Two of the terrorists were lured from the plane by the promise that they could make a statement to the press.  Once on the ground, they were immediately overpowered.  In an escape set up by hand signals, the pilot of the jetliner sent the plane lurching forward, knocking everyone standing in the plane off their feet.  Some of the passengers then took advantage of the confusion to overpower the two gunmen left.  One terrorist lost his weapon and either jumped or was thrown from the plane.  All 91 passengers were freed.  Five incurred minor injuries when one of the attacked hijackers began to shoot his pistol wildly.  Two of the hijackers were also wounded.The gunmen were identified as members of an extremist Marxist group, Dev Sol, whose members had been severely cracked down on by the Turkish military authorities.  The latter had seized power in September 1980, saying the elected government had been unable to quell violence between the left and right.  Since then, thousands of suspected political extremists have been arrested.
FRANCE.  A bomb exploded outside the Armenian Cultural Center in Paris, killing the caretaker of an adjacent building.  The attack was claimed a few days later by the Turkish Islamic Revolutionary Army.  The anti- Armenian attack was unprecedented in Paris, but officials noted, may be due to the recent Armenian terrorist attacks against Turkish diplomats.  One Armenian official noted that the bomb was set probably to mark the anniversary date of the creation of the Republic of Armenia on May 28, 1918.  Armenian was later divided between Turkey and the Soviet Union in 1920.
BELGIUM.  An unidentified gunman shot and killed the Brussels representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization outside of his residence--an attack that provoked a sharp verbal exchange between the PLO and the Israeli Embassy in Belgium.  The PLO accused the Israelis of killing Naim Khader, 41, a key figure in relations between Western Europe and the Arab world.  The Israelis denied the allegation, stating that We know the various Palestinian movements kill each other. Khader was unpopular with extremist Palestinians because he favored limited compromise.The gunman was described as dark-skinned with a mustache.  He fired six bullets at Khader at close range, and although bystanders pursued him, he escaped in a waiting car.
ISRAEL.  Two bombs were found in a national park near Dimona.  Bomb squad experts detonated the explosives.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  A bomb set off by suspected antimilitary terrorists ripped through a half-finished NATO arms depot southwest of Hanover, causing an estimated $130,000 in damage.  There were no injuries. This was the fourth such attack this year against US military targets. Terrorists linked to the Red Army Faction were suspected.
BELGIUM.  A series of violent incidents in Brussels were linked to disturbances by ethnic Albanian nationalists in Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province earlier in the year.  Belgian authorities reported numerous threats made against Yugoslavian citizens as well as fires at the Yugoslav airline and tourist office in Brussels.
PERU.  Unidentified persons threw two powerful explosives at the Chinese Embassy from the window of their speeding car.  There were no injuries but the guard forces at the building were put on alert.
UNITED STATES.  The death of a Libyan student in Ogden, Utah, was declared by the FBI to be politically motivated.  Investigators claimed that positive indications had developed that linked the killing to internal Libyan politics.  A suspect, another Libyan student, was arrested in connection with the death of Nabil Abuzed Mansour who had been discovered in the trunk of his automobile, shot five times at close range.  The suspect, Mohamed Shabata, was arrested in Chicago, Illinois as he prepared to board a flight for London on his way to Tripoli.  Authorities believe that the killing is connected to other assassinations of Libyan exiles.
SWITZERLAND.  In its third bombing in three days, the Ninth of June Organization claimed credit for an explosion which ripped through a department store in Lausanne, injuring twenty people.  The injuries were mainly to women shoppers in the women's wear department but none were serious.  The explosion caused heavy damage to the store.  The Swiss authorities speculated that the bombings were in response to the arrest of an Armenian militant suspected of the assassination of a Turkish consulate employee.
GREECE.  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb attack on a Piraeus shipping and travel agency in which 2 people were killed and 70 injured.  The Popular Front said the agency was serving as a front organization for Israeli intelligence interests and was involved in the killing of one of the Palestinian group's members.  The two killed were Evgenia Angelikoussi, owner of the agency and an associate, Dimitrios Malatasis.  The PFLP insisted that Angelikoussi was a member of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. The next day the PLO Liaison and Information Bureau in Athens disclaimed responsibility for the attack.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  A Romanian-born employee of the U.S.-financed Radio Free Europe was stabbed outside his home.  He survived the attack. Authorities said the motive for the attack was unclear.  The victim was identified as Emil Georgescu, 51, supervising program editor in the station's Romanian service.  Local police arrested the attacker and an accomplice--both French citizens.  Mrs. Georgescu identified the attacker.
LEBANON.  In the Syrian-controlled area of west Beirut, there were several attacks against French interests, including a bombing at an Air France airlines office.  Some sources suspect Abu Nidal's Syrian backed group, Al Assifa, because of France's efforts to mediate the PLO question.
BELGIUM.  An early morning shooting at a Brussels cafe resulted in the death of an accountant and the wounding of a porter.  Both were employees of the Yugoslav embassy.  The killer escaped.  The attack was claimed by an Albanian independence movement, which declared the purpose of its act was to avenge our thousands of Albanian brothers pursued and persecuted in Kosovo.  On March 18, 1982, however, Musi Hoti, a Yugoslav national born in Kosovo but who had been living in Brussels for several years, was arrested for the murder of the accountant Stojan Djeric, and wounding the bodyguard, Redzo Zuko.  There is a question about whether or not there was a political motivation in the shooting or whether it was really just a barroom fight.
UNITED STATES.  Twenty-four people claiming to be members of the Mujahedeen Khalq took over the Iranian interests section of the Algerian embassy and held six hostages for less than an hour before police broke the siege. Three people were injured in the takeover, including one person who was shot.
ISRAEL.  The PLO claimed responsibility for the planting of several bombs near the entrance to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and near the town of Neve Ya' Acov.  The boobytrapped bombs were successfully detonated by Israeli security personnel in a safe location.
LIBYA.  Explosives were discovered aboard a Middle East Airlines plane when it landed in Tripoli.  Militant Shi'ites are suspected because of similar actions perpetrated to protest the disappearance of their leader during a visit to Libya in 1978.
FRANCE.  An explosion in the early morning hours in front of the Alitalia Airline office on the Champs Elysee in Paris broke the front window but caused no injuries.  A call to the French news agency by an unidentified caller claimed the Armenian Movement 3 October was responsible for the bombing.
COLOMBIA.  A tin can filled with dynamite exploded in the men's room of the U.S.-run Colombo-American Institute in Barranquilla.  No injuries were reported.
LEBANON.  A bomb exploded in an empty Middle East Airlines Boeing 720. There were no casualties.  Lebanese officials suspected that the device was planted by Lebanese Shi'ite groups protesting the 1978 disappearance of their leader, Iranian-born Imam Musa Sadr, while on a visit in Libya.
PERU.  In a bombing campaign directed against U.S. firms in Lima, the local offices of the Ford Motor Company was bombed, as was the Bank of America, the Coca-Cola Company and the G. Berckemeyer Co. (representative of the Carnation Company).  Sendero Luminoso was suspected.
UNITED STATES.  A flare was fired at the Long Island home of the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations.  Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko was a guest at the time in the ambassador's home.  Later in November (see November 14, 1981) a teenager was arrested and charged with the attack after several similar actions were carried out against Soviet interests and were claimed by the Jewish Defense League.
UNITED STATES.  New York.  A car belonging to a Nigerian diplomat was firebombed.  There were no injuries and little damage.  The car was parked at the Soviet U.N. mission and it was believed that the bomb was aimed at the Soviets.  The Thunder of Zion branch of the Jewish Defense League claimed responsibility for the act but a later call from the JDL denied responsibility for the bombing but applauded it.
COLOMBIA.  A bomb was set off at the Venezuelan Consulate in a residential district of northern Bogota.  There was only minor damage.  The Workers' Self-Defense Movement claimed credit for the explosion.
PERU.  During another wave of bombings in Lima, one of the targets was a textile firm with U.S. connections.  Sendero Luminoso was suspected.
UNITED STATES.  New York.  An anti-Castro terrorist group claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Mexican consular building six blocks from the United Nations.  There were no injuries from the early morning blast but severe damage.  A man claiming to be a member of Omega-7 called a Spanish radio station 15 minutes after the explosion to take responsibility for the blast.  He identified himself as Omar, an Omega Commando.
DENMARK.  A group calling itself the Sixth Armenian Liberation Army called the Danish media and claimed responsibility for an explosion during the night at the Turkish Airlines Office in Copenhagen.  Two people were injured in the attack, one of them seriously.  The offices were severely damaged.  A man was seen shortly before the explosion placing two plastic bags outside the building.  Only one of the bags containing explosives went off.  The second bomb was detonated by army experts. (ASALA claimed in Armenia, in name of Martyr Hagop Darakjian Commando, with one death.)
IRAN.  A bomb damaged the doors and windows of a Swiss Embassy building in Tehran and an Armenian group claimed responsibility.  No one was hurt in the explosion.  The Ninth of June Organization has been targeting Swiss interests to obtain the release of one of their members.
LEBANON.  The fourth terrorist bomb in as many days exploded in a crowded movie theater in the Moslem section of west Beirut, killing at least four people and wounding 36 others.  As in the other bombings, the Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call to AFP.  The caller said that this operation of ours is to prove to the PLO that we are not a fictitious group and all the threats in the world against us will remain fictitious, a statement which possibly referred to the PLO's assertion that the group was merely a fictitious front for Israeli operations.
PERU.  Four hooded men evidently attempting to toss explosives at the Chilean Embassy in Lima were taken by surprise during the night as their car approached the Embassy grounds.  A police car patrolling the area gave pursuit but was unable to apprehend the terrorists.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  Three cars were set on fire while they were parked within a U.S. Army housing area in Stuttgart.  One car was completely destroyed.  Two other cars were damaged.  No injuries were reported.
LEBANON.  A Mercedes-Benz parked near a restaurant in a south Lebanon village exploded killing 15 people and injuring at least 40 others, mainly pedestrians.  The car exploded a short distance from a checkpoint where two militia units were searching for explosive devices.  Witnesses said several guerrillas manning the checkpoint were victims in the blast. Similar bombings in the past month have been claimed by the Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners, a rightist group intent on freeing Lebanon of Palestinian and Syrian troops.
SWITZERLAND.  Two bombs went off in the center of Geneva and Armenian extremists claimed responsibility.  The police said one person was injured slightly and some shop windows were shattered.  The explosive devices were set off at the entrance of the main post office and at the city courthouse, where a member of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia is to be tried for murder.  A caller to the Geneva bureau of Agence France- Presse said the bombs were placed by the June 9 Organization.
TURKEY.  Anti-Khomeini forces shot up and ransacked the Iranian consulate in Istanbul to protest the mounting number of executions and oppressions of the Khomeini regime.  Three people were wounded in the shooting during the seizure.  The 26 masked Iranians, said to be students, held the consulate for about 50 minutes before Turkish police surrounded the building and broke the seige.  The Consul General and eight staff members had been taken hostage at gunpoint and led to the basement, while the dissidents threw out furniture and caused extensive damage to the interior of the consulate.
ITALY.  At about the same time as a bombing at El Al airlines office, there was a powerful bomb explosion in a busy square in Ostia, west of Rome, where thousands of Soviet Jews live, waiting for visas to the United States and other Western countries.  Five people, two of them Soviet Jews, three of them Italians, were injured in the attack on the square where the Jews traditionally gather in the evening to chat.  Officials believe the attack was timed to coincide with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  Bombs exploded at two different Yugoslav restaurants in Munich within a few hours of each other.  Police suspect that the bombs were planted in protest against the recent murder of a Croatian exile living in Munich.  Two people were injured in the bombings and there was an estimated $50,000 in damage.
BELGIUM.  A bomb exploded in a truck near a synagogue in the heart of the diamond center in Antwerp shortly before a scheduled Jewish ceremony in a tremendous blast that killed four people and injured 95 others.  The bomb had been planted in a delivery truck parked the night before.  It was parked illegally but a wheel had been removed as if it had broken down. The blast heavily damaged buildings in the thriving diamond district of Antwerp's Jewish quarter.  An anonymous caller told the Belgian news agency Belga the attack was carried out by the Group of Direct Action, Belgian Section. This refers to the French group which has never before perpetrated an action outside French borders.  A caller claiming to be from Direct Action called the French press and disclaimed the incident entirely.The next day the attack was claimed by a caller speaking for Black September.  The caller said that three more bomb attacks were planned for Belgium.  He ended the call shouting several times Palestine will conquer.On the same feast day last year, a bomb attached to a parked motorbike exploded in Paris outside a synagogue on the Rue Copernic, killing four people. (See October 3, 1980) Other similarities with the Paris synagogue attack and the Antwerp one appeared when the owner of the van was traced. The van had been purchased only a few days earlier by a Nicolas Brazzi from a used car dealer.  Brazzi, and his female companion who could speak some French, were traced to a Brussels hotel, where he registered claiming Cypriot nationality, just as was claimed by the owner, Panadryu, of the motorbike which blew up outside the Paris synagogue.
ITALY.  Bombs exploded outside the offices in Rome of Reader's Digest, the Bank of America and the Avis Rental Car Company. Callers to newspapers and news agencies claimed responsibility for the bombings in the name of the Communist Groups for Proletarian Internationalism, a previously unknown group.
ITALY.  A bomb exploded in Rome outside the offices of the Guatemalan government.  The blast caused no injuries and was claimed by the Communist Groups for Proletarian Internationalism.
FRANCE.  An explosion in a booby-trapped car on the Champs-Elysees in Paris destroyed the parked car but injured no one.  The explosion was in front of a fashionable snack and shop establishment called Le Drugstore.  A series of similar attacks during the following week baffled police.  Some of the attacks were claimed by a mysterious Liberation Army of Canaque, but the militant separatists of New Caledonia denied responsibility.  A new group called September-France (perhaps an Armenian group protesting the arrest of four Armenians after the takeover of the Turkish consulate on September 24) also claimed credit for many of the attacks.  Authorities also suspect the extreme right and Action Directe.  (ASALA listed this incident in its chronology of actions in Armenia)
COSTA RICA.  A small plane with 26 passengers and three crewmembers was hijacked by five Nicaraguan rightists demanding the release of six Nicaraguans convicted of trying to blow up a Costa Rican radio station that they said broadcast propaganda for the leftist rulers of Nicaragua.  The plane was taken over during a domestic flight and was held at the Juan Santamaria Airport in Costa Rica.  Four Americans were listed aboard the plane.  Shortly after landing, the hijackers released eight passengers, including women, children and two sick passengers.  The group, called the Nicaraguan Anti-Communist Democratic Movement released a communique listing the names of the prisoners to be released within 4 hours, and declared that noncompliance with their demands would result in the execution of one hostage for each hour past the deadline.  They also requested fuel and a navigation map of South America.The six prisoners were surrendered to the hijackers and the remaining hostages were freed except for the pilot.  He was forced under pain of death to fly them to an undisclosed location.  The pilot returned with his empty plane four hours later.  Later, in El Salvador, the eleven fugitives were arrested on an isolated air strip near San Miguel.  A Salvadoran military spokesman said the hijackers, who were believed to be three men and two women, were detained along with the freed prisoners in El Salvador pending extradition proceedings.  Later in mid-November El Salvador denied the extradition request.
FRANCE.  A bomb exploded at Paris' Gare de Lyon train station injuring at least one person and destroying more than two dozen luggage lockers. Officials said the explosion occurred in an underground level of the station, which houses the suburban subway line.  Later, the attack was claimed by the previously unknown Orly Organization, an Armenian group.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  The Yugoslav cultural center was bombed in Stuttgart.  Albanian nationalists were suspected.
FRANCE.  A bomb slightly damaged an automobile parked near the Eiffel Tower. Moments after the blast, which injured no one, the Orly group, an Armenian organization telephoned AFP in Beirut and Paris and claimed responsibility for the incident.  The Paris caller said the explosion was the first warning.
LEBANON.  The Banque Libano Francaise and the Union des Assurances de Paris were bombed in East Beirut.  Damage was extensive but there were no injuries.  The attacks were claimed by the Orly Organization. (ASALA later listed in its chronology of Orly actions in Armenia, the bombing of the Fransa Bank in Zouk Michael, Beirut; the bombing of the Banque Union de Paris in Bourj Hamoud, Beirut.)
FRANCE.  A bomb placed in a luggage locker exploded in the Gare de l'Est railway terminal, wounding two people.  Thirty lockers were destroyed. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Orly Group of Armenian extremists.
FRANCE.  Responsibiliity for a fire bomb attack that destroyed two Soviet Embassy vehicles parked on a Paris street was claimed by Ukrainian nationalists.  The caller claimed to be a member of a group called Bandera, a reference to Etienne Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist who was active in the 1930s, and was murdered.  He said the attack was to commemorate the rebirth of Ukraine.
ANGOLA.  The Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) bombed a Belgian-owned oil refinery in Luanda as a part of its struggle to destroy the economic base of the current Marxist government which counts on oil production for 80% of its foreign exchange earnings.  The sabotage team managed to destroy one of the three distillation units, an act which is expected to put the refinery out of operation for at least two months.
VENEZUELA.  A group of eleven, hooded, armed terrorists claiming to be Puerto Rican independence fighters and backers of El Salvador's leftist guerrillas hijacked three Venezuelan airliners with more than 260 people on board in a meticulously planned and executed operation.  In a 30-hour ordeal which ended in Cuba, the planes traveled from Venezuela to Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Panama for refueling and the release of some 130 of the passengers, mainly women and children in exchange for maps of Central America, food, medical supplies and fuel.There was confusion as to the actual identity of the hijackers--one referred to the group as members of the Ramon Emeterio Betances Puerto Rico Independence Commandos.  Some released passengers stated that they wore armbands El Salvador will win!, and passed out leaflets with the signature of FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front), while ground controllers said that one had a Venezuelan accent.  In Caracas, authorities said they believed the gunmen were linked to Venezuela's Red Flag guerrilla group, or Colombia's M-19.  One priest said the terrorists on his plane identified themselves to him as a Salvadoran, a Puerto Rican, and a Venezuelan.  The leaders of each plane's group were known simply as Commandantes 9, 10, and 11.There was also confusion about what the terrorists were demanding.  Each of the respective governments were secretive about their dealings with the terrorists.  Bogota Radio, however, read the group's communique over the air in which they requested the release of several Venezuelan political prisoners being held in Caracas, a ransom of $10 million, and the publication of their communique in the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Venezuela.In a 1973 hijacking agreement signed with Venezuela, Cuba is obligated to return the three Venezuelan planes, the hijackers and all others aboard. On arrival in Havana, the gunmen were taken into custody by Cuban police, but there was no immediate indication of their fate.  Cuba has stated only that they are under arrest and will be tried in Cuba.
LEBANON.  A bomb exploded near the residence of the newly-arrived French ambassador, killing a man and wounding four others.  The bomb had been hidden in a fruit cart parked in predominantly Moslem West Beirut near the border with East Beirut.  The residence of the French Ambassador Paul March-Henry was not damaged.  His predecessor, Louis Delamare, was killed in September by unidentified gunmen. (See 9/4 incident.)

LEBANON.  A suicide terrorist driving a car packed with explosives sped through machine gun fire into the compound of the Iraqi Embassy causing two explosions which completely demolished the building and resulted in over 100 wounded and at least 61 dead.  The explosion damaged nearby buildings and cars, injuring many within the block.  The Iraqi Ambassador, Abdul Razzak Lafta was among the dead; his body was found 10 days later.The disastrous attack was claimed by the Army for the Liberation of Kurdistan, an area of Iran under Iraqi control.  Another call to AFP claimed responsibility for the attack under the name of the Iraqi Liberation Army - General Command.On December 17, a spokesman for an Iraqi Moslem fundamentalist group, al Dawa, whose name means the call, said his group was responsible for the explosion that destroyed the Iraqi Embassy.
GUATEMALA.  Leftist guerrillas burned the El Salvador Consulate in Guatemala City.  The consulate was completely burned out and all the documents of Salvadoran citizens in Guatemala were destroyed.  At the same time rockets were fired at the police station and the Chamber of Commerce. A previously unknown group, the Roque Dalton Commando, claimed responsibility for the attack.  The name is apparently that of a Salvadoran Communist poet.
TURKEY.  An explosion was reported in the Iraq-Iskenderun pipeline which carries crude oil from Kirkuk to the Mediterranean terminal of Yumurtalik. The explosion occurred 7km from Idil, a town in Mardin Province, and teams were investigating the cause.  Oil was leaking out of the damaged section of the pipeline.  This is an Iraqi pipeline. (See 1/8/82)
TURKEY.  An Iraqi oil pipeline has been cut by an explosion for the second time in a week.  Turkish authorities said the 625-mile pipeline that brings Iraqi oil to Turkey's Mediterranean coast exploded 42 miles inside the Turkish border and sabotage was suspected.  The explosions on Iraqi lines have damaged the country's efforts to increase its oil exports. (see 1/6/82)
FRANCE.  Three bombs exploded nearly simultaneously in Paris.  The attacks were directed against companies with direct relations with East European countries, namely, Poland and the Soviet Union.   There was considerable damage but no injuries.  The attacks were claimed by the Bakounine Gdansk Paris Group, named after a Russian revolutionary anarchist of the mid-1800s.
FRANCE.  The Armenian group, the Orly Organization, claimed credit for an explosion in a branch of the Union of Banks of Paris, as well as the placement of another bomb which was dismantled in time at a branch of the Credit Lyonnaise.  According to the anonymous caller to AFP these two actions were to protest the continued imprisonment of Armenian militants.
ISRAEL.  A bomb exploded outside the main office of West Germany's Lufthansa Airlines in Tel Aviv's seaside hotel district.  The blast broke windows and damaged the building but caused no injuries.  According to police, the incident may be linked to a recent bomb attack on a Jewish restaurant in West Berlin in which 25 people were injured.
ITALY.  A bomb exploded outside the office of the Italian Chamber of Commerce for the United States in Rome leaving a large hole in the floor of the U.S. trade office.  The bomb destroyed a door, shattered windows, and damaged an elevator shaft in the building.  No injuries were reported.  An anonymous caller to the Italian news agency ANSA claimed the bombing was carried out by the Groups of Internationalist Communist.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  The police reported that the explosion of a bomb destroyed the door and several windows of the honorary Salvadoran Consulate building in Cologne.  The explosion did not damage any records or documents.  The police have no clues as to the motive for the attack.
COLOMBIA.  Seven guerrillas hijacked a Colombian 727 jetliner with 128 aboard shortly after takeoff from Bogota's El Dorado Airport on a flight to Pereira, and forced the pilot to return to the Bogota airport.  The heavily-armed hijackers told authorities that they were members of the April 19 Movement (M-19), Colombia's most active rebel group which reportedly received military training in Cuba.  They threatened to blow up the plane if the army moved in, and demanded that a reporter from the Bogota newspaper El Espectador come aboard the plane to take the hijackers' demands to the Colombian authorities.  They also asked to see a member of a peace commission which was set up in 1981 to negotiate an end to guerrilla activities in Colombia.  It is not known if the authorities met any of the demands before the plane flew on to Cali, where the hijackers released 47 of the passengers.  The 727 was damaged during a takeoff from Cali.  In a deal with the Army, the hijackers released the rest of the passengers and crew in return for a light executive plane which flew them to Cuba.
FRANCE.  Bombs exploded at the French headquarters of the U.S. appliance firm Bendix, and an electrical appliance shop selling U.S. products. A group calling itself Bakounine-Gdansk-Paris-Guatemala-Salvador claimed responsibility for the bombings in a communique to a news agency.

UNITED STATES.  A firebomb was thrown and a machine gun fired into a cigar company, El Padron Cigars, which over the years has been the target of five terrorist attacks, but caused only minor damage. The owner of the cigar company, Jose Orlando Padron, has voiced his support of efforts to normalize relations between the U.S. and Cuba.Less than an hour later, unknown gunmen (presumed to belong to Omega- 7) shattered windows at the Hispania Freight Company, which handles shipments to Cuba.  The firm's Hialeah office was also attacked.
TANZANIA. An Air Tanzanian airline Boeing 737 with 99 passengers and crew members on a domestic flight to Dar es Salaam was commandeered by five Tanzanians and forced to land at Nairobi for refueling.  The plane made more refueling stops in Kenya, Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and Athens before landing in Stansted, England.  The English police authorities refused to allow the plane to refuel and take off.  A pregnant woman and a child were freed earlier in the day by the hijackers who demanded the removal of Tanzania's socialist leader, President Julius Nyerere.  They had also released six passengers in Nairobi and two in Athens.  The remaining passengers were believed to be Tanzanians.  One of the freed passengers reported that there were four hijackers armed with pistols, hand grenades and machine guns who said they belonged to the Tanzanian Youth Democratic Movement.  The hijackers threatened to blow up the plane if it was approached.After three days, the hijackers freed the last 90 passengers and surrendered to British police who arrested them.  They accused Nyerere of imposing intolerable economic conditions on their East African nation. Nyerere has been attempting to combine socialism with democracy.  The drama was brought to an end with the intervention of former Tanzanian Foreign Minister Oscar Kambona, an exile, who persuaded the youths to surrender. The youths were remanded by a court to face trial.  On September 18, the five youths were convicted and sentenced to prison terms of between four and eight years.
LEBANON.  Explosives blew up a Lebanese cargo ship at the Palestinian guerrilla-controlled port of Tyre.  The blast occurred despite severe security precautions by local armed elements.  There was no estimate of damage; authorities noted that the ship had been followed for quite a while into Lebanese waters by an Israeli gunboat.  The Israeli military denied any responsibility for the attack.
SUDAN.  U.S. intelligence has what it calls physical evidence of a Libyan plot to kill several hundred Americans living in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.  According to an official account, two bombs disguised as stereo speakers, each packed with more than 40 pounds of plastique explosive, were to have been planted in the dance hall in the American recreation club in Khartoum and set to go off over a weekend when the hall would be full of American diplomats, workers, and their families.  Fortunately, the bombs were discovered in Nairobi, en route to Khartoum.  U.S. government sources say that Libyan intelligence officers working out of Kenya prepared the bombs and personally assured that the bombs were boarded on a flight to Khartoum.
LEBANON.  The second secretary of the British embassy, a Lebanese British subject, Mohammed al-Mikdad, was kidnapped in Beirut and later released. The family did not say who the abductors were or if the $150,000 ransom demanded by them was paid.  Lebanese authorities viewed the incident as another in a series of recent terrorist actions aimed at diplomats.
GREECE.  Two cars belonging to U.S. military personnel and displaying U.S. military license plates were bombed in Thessalonika.  The cars were destroyed; no injuries were reported.  No group claimed responsibility.
UNITED STATES.  A Cambridge, Mass., import shop owned by Orhan Gunduz, honorary Turkish consul general, was bombed, causing severe damage. Police stated a caller claiming to represent an Armenian nationalist group had claimed credit.  Such a group has spread a reign of terror by assassinating Turkish officials in the United States.  The Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide contend that the Turks massacred over a million Armenians in Turkey in 1915 and drove hundreds of thousands more into exile.  The group demands reparation for the relatives plus an acknowledgment from the Turkish government that it is responsible for the crime.
LEBANON.  ASALA claimed credit for the bombing of a movie theater in the Armenian section of Beirut which caused two deaths and more than 16 injuries.  ASALA said the movie theater frequently featured films either made in Turkey or spoken in Turkish.

ARGENTINA.  An explosion in a U.S.-owned bank in Buenos Aires caused some damage.
HONDURAS.  Gunmen in a speeding taxi raked the U.S. embassy building in Tegucigalpa with pistol and submachine gun fire, causing minor damage but no injuries.

CANADA.  Kani Gungor, a commercial counselor at the Turkish embassy in Ottawa, was seriously wounded by gunmen in the parking garage of his town- house. In Beirut, Lebanon, the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia assumed responsibility in a call to the media.  A letter from the group was also mailed to the media in Los Angeles, California. It reinforced the claim in the name of the Zaven Abedian Commando Group of ASALA.  The attack prompted Canadian authorities to improve security measures at the U.S., French, and Swiss embassies.  All three countries had Armenians in custody for attacks on Turkish targets.
ISRAEL.  An American-born Jew, Alan Goodman from Tenafly, New Jersey, wearing an Israeli army uniform, sprayed Islam's Dome of the Rock shrine with automatic rifle fire, killing two Arabs and touching off some of the worst Arab rioting in Jerusalem since Israel captured and annexed the eastern part of the city in 1967.  At least 25 people were wounded and 150 required medical treatment for injuries or tear gas inhalation.  Police captured the gunman and hustled him away to save him from the angry Arabs.  Goodman had been studying at a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem for six years and apparently was an Israeli army reservist.  A lot of my friends and relatives have been killed, and I must take revenge, he told police after his capture.  The Jewish community and officials denied that the Jewish nation would condone or abet such an action which was obviously the act of a deranged man. The act set off demonstrations in the West Bank towns and a resumption of the general disorder that had afflicted the area for several weeks. Goodman went on trial on September 8th, after doctors testified that although he lived in a fantasy world, he was responsible for his actions.
GUATEMALA.  An executive of the Coca-Cola Company was assassinated.

Three hours after the blast, two Syrian diplomats were ordered from France and the French ambassador to Damascus was recalled to Paris.  French Interior Minister Gaston Defferre declared the method of the bombing was indicative of the mentality of the perpetrators of this type of attack, who do not hesitate to spill blood on French territory to settle accounts in which France has no involvement.  The explosion was outside the office of the Lebanese-based weekly Al Watan Al-Arabi, which accused the Syrian secret services, and notably those in Paris, of having organized the attack.  It was not the first attempt on the life of the owner of the publication.
NETHERLANDS.  A powerful bomb was discovered and disarmed in time at the Kuwaiti consulate in the Hague.

There were no injuries but substantial damage to the building was incurred.
IRAN.  A car laden with explosives blew up outside the Syrian embassy in Tehran,  destroying the four-story building and injuring 16 passers-by.  None of the embassy employees were in the building at the time.  The Syrian ambassador to Iran blamed the attack on Iraq and elements of imperialism and Israel.  Attacks on foreign missions have escalated in Tehran, especially those whose governments maintain friendly relations with the Islamic government of Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
PORTUGAL.  The Rev. Juan Maria Fernandez Krohn was charged with attempted murder against Pope John Paul and ordered held for trial. The accused, a Spanish Roman Catholic priest who lives in France, rushed at the Pope with a bayonet as the Pope was climbing an altar of a church in Lisbon.  Investigating police stated that the attack probably had a religious motivation, perhaps related to the fact that the attacker had had his ecclesiastical education at a seminary founded by Msgr. Marcel Lefebvre, who was suspended by Pope Paul for supporting traditional Roman Catholicism in opposition to the changes of the Second Vatican Council.  Father Fernandez lived in the suburbs of France and administered to a small group of followers of Msgr. Levebvre. Witnesses reported that the man shouted Down with the Pope and down with Vatican .  At his trial in October, Krohn stated that he acted because the pontiff betrayed the church and encouraged communism through compromise with Soviet-Bloc countries.  He said he got the idea when he saw the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on television.
ISRAEL.  Two firebombs were thrown at a military vehicle on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem, damaging the vehicle but causing no injuries.  The attack came a day after the Israeli Cabinet reportedly decided to avoid a confrontation with Palestinian guerrillas along the Lebanese border.
ANGOLA.  The Red Cross International Committee reported that one of its Swiss nurses, Marie-Jose Burnier, was kidnapped by armed individuals during an attack on a Red Cross convoy in the Katchungo region.

UNITED STATES.  Three members of an Armenian terrorist group, the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, were arrested and accused of placing an explosive device in front of the Air Canada cargo building at Los Angeles International Airport.  The bomb was defused by members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad. The arrests, made later in the day, were the culmination of four months of joint investigation by the FBI, Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office of a series of local bombings dating back to 1980.  The three accused are Hratch Kozibioukian, his wife Stanouche Kozibioukian, and Varant Barkev Chirinian.  Police believe this latest bombing may have been retaliation for the arrest of Armenians in Canada two weeks ago.  A fourth member, Vicken Tcharkhutian, was discovered in France.  The U.S. request for his extradition was refused by a French court on grounds that the 1909 Franco-American extradition treaty does not cover bomb fabrication.  France did expel the Armenian, however, who left for Cyprus, and thence to Libya.Tcharkhutian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in October, 1987.  In November he admitted in federal court to his involvement in a series of bombings in the U.S.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  Bombs exploded in four separate U.S. military facilities causing more than 180,000 dollars in damage but no injuries. The facilities were at Bamberg, Hanau, Gelnhausen, and Frankfurt.   The explosions came just a day before President Reagan arrived in Europe on his first visit since taking office. Tens of thousands of Europeans opposed to the deployment of new U.S. missiles in Europe were expected to rally in capitals the President will visit.  The Revolutionary Cells, believed to be an offshoot of the Red Army Faction, or Baader-Meinhof Gang, claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating the bombings were just a prelude.
GREECE.  In Athens, the Revolutionary People's Struggle (ELA) took responsibility for burning three cars belonging to foreign diplomatic missions.  One belonged to John Bung, an American serving with the Iraklion base in Crete. An ELA statement said that the multinational Honeywell-Bull Company has merged with ITT.  It is believed that ELA was under the impression that all the cars belonged to American military personnel.
UNITED KINGDOM.  Israeli Ambassador to Britain Shlomo Argov was shot and critically wounded in the head while leaving a banquet in London by an assailant wielding a submachine gun and aided by accomplices. The Palestine Liberation Organization denied having anything to do with the attack but Israel warned of retaliation.  Five weeks later, Israeli planes bombarded Lebanese PLO targets and Israeli troops moved in and was taken into custody.  Three Arabs--two Jordanians and one Iraqi-- were later arrested and charged.  The three belong to a dissident Arab terrorist group named Black June that now operates out of Syria and is openly hostile to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.  The shooting of Argov was a critical event in the sequence leading to Israel's invasion of Lebanon. On June 10, a dissident Palestinian group called al-Asifa, which split from the PLO in the early 1970s, claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt.  Argov regained consciousness on July 14.
PORTUGAL.  Erkut Akbay, an administrative official at the Turkish Embassy in Lisbon, was assassinated as a result of an armed attack.  His wife, Nadid Akbay, a secretary at the embassy, was seriously injured.  After eight months in a coma, she died in January 1983.  A man lay in wait for them at the door of their home, shot both with a 9mm revolver, which he left at the scene, and fled.  A clandestine Armenian terror organization assumed responsibility for the attack.  No one has been apprehended.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  Nine firms in Essen, Hochum, Duesseldorf, and Muenster which are partly U.S.-owned, received letters containing incendiary devices.  All letters were opened safely.  The letters were mailed from Hagen/Westfalen.  In the padded envelopes were an alarm clock, a flat battery and a cigarillo packet filled with a plasticine-like substance, which initial examination showed to be inflammable but not explosive.  A message read In the next war no one will be innocent.  Stop the madness.  We wish mister president and his friends a hot reception.

The attack was believed to be due to Arab discontent with Zaire's diplomatic relationship with Israel.
COSTA RICA.  A bomb destroyed the main office of Honduran Air Services in the downtown section of San Jose.  The explosion also affected nearby establishments.  No group claimed credit for the attack, but the government of Costa Rica accused three Nicaraguan diplomats of taking part in the bombings, and demanded that they leave Costa Rica. On July 10, a dozen members of the right wing Nicaraguan Democratic Movement were jailed in San Jose when authorities linked them to the blasts and confiscated a pile of documents in their headquarters. On July 29, the Costa Rican government expelled three Nicaraguan diplomats after accusing them of complicity in the airline office bombing. Two Costa Rican diplomats were expelled from Managua and recognition of a Costa Rican consul was withdrawn in retaliation.

UNITED STATES.  A ticking gasoline bomb was removed from the doorway of Yugoslav Airlines near St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. The bomb was described as awesome in its potential and authorities stated that if it had exploded, the devastation in life and property would have been tragic.  The bomb was later disassembled at the police detonating range.  Croatian nationalists are believed responsible.
LEBANON.  Unidentified gunmen kidnapped David Dodge, the acting president of the American University of Beirut, as he was walking home from his office.  Witnesses reported that at least two men armed with pistols threatened the educator, struck him when he resisted, forced him into a red automobile, and sped away.  Dodge had lived in Beirut for three decades. Lebanese officials stated that Dodge is almost certainly held by Iranian Embassy officials hoping to exchange him for an Iranian envoy who may have been kidnapped earlier in the month. (Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohsen Mousavi: 7/04/82).  But on August 3, Lebanese security sources stated that Dodge was being held by a splinter group of the pro-Iranian militia Shiite Moslem Amal, seeking the freedom of an Iranian diplomat and aides kidnapped by Christian militiamen in East Beirut.  He was still unconscious from the blow he received on the head when he was abducted.Dodge was freed by his abductors in July of 1983 in good physical and mental condition.  No details were made available.
FRANCE.  A bomb exploded near a crowded cafe in the Place Saint-Sevrin (Latin Quarter of Paris), injuring 16 people.  An Armenian nationalist group (Orly) took responsibility in a phone call to the French news agency, asserting that the bomb was in protest for the French government's failure to keep a promise to grant political asylum to four members of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, arrested in the takeover of the Turkish consulate in Paris on September 24, 1981.
FRANCE.  A bomb exploded at the Pub Saint Germain in Paris, injuring two people slightly.

The owners of the bank are Jewish but authorities refused to speculate on whether the attack was linked to other previous incidents against Jewish property.
AFGHANISTAN.  Rebels attacked the Soviet Embassy in the Afghan capital of Kabul wounding two government soldiers protecting the embassy and capturing two others.  The embassy attack followed several attacks in Kabul against the Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan since December 1979.  A diplomatic source speculated that some of the incidents are being sparked by a conscription drive launched in July by the Soviet supported Babrak Karmal regime to press recruits into the Afghan Army.
FRANCE.  A powerful bomb heavily damaged a bank patronized by Jewish residents in the east of Paris; a bank official theorized that the blast was connected with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  The bomb left a wrought-iron security rail on a window shattered, together with shattered windows and facades throughout the neighborhood.  The bank was once owned by the prominent Jewish Rothschilds family.
FRANCE.  Police managed to defuse an explosive device that was set to go off near a telephone center located in the 17th section of Paris. An unidentified person claiming to represent the Orly Group took credit for the blast in a telephone call; he apparently was unaware that the bomb had been defused.  The group appears to protest the arrest of Viken Charkhoudian, an Armenian from Iraq, who had been arrested in Los Angeles two months ago as an accomplice in an attempt to bomb Air Canada facilities.
FRANCE.  A little-known anarchist Bakunin-Gdansk Group claimed responsibility for an attack on the South African citrus fruit company.

The bomb thrown at the synagogue failed to explode.
FRANCE.  An unidentified gunman riding in a speeding car fired at police guarding a Turkish travel agency in Paris.  No injuries were reported, but police said the 22mm rifle shot missed the guards and smashed a hole in a nearby window.  The travel agency is part of a complex of buildings housing offices of Middle Eastern governments.  The upsurge of international terrorism in France has led to calls for restriction of France's traditionally liberal policies on political asylum .
PORTUGAL.  A hitherto unknown Zionist Action Group claimed bomb attacks on Air France and West German Lufthansa airline offices which left heavy damage but no casualties.  The group, in a call to the Portuguese ANOP news agency, said the attacks were in protest against French and West German government policy towards Israel.

None of the 63 passengers and six crew members was injured.
UNITED STATES.  Pan American World Airways planes are being subjected to random searches, and security has been increased since a cleaning woman discovered a bomb on a Pan Am jet on its arrival in Rio de Janeiro from Miami.  The book-size device was removed.  No threat was received. Pan Am and Delta Airlines started spot checks on their planes.
UNITED STATES.  An explosion ripped the Venezuelan consulate offices in downtown Miami.  No injuries were reported at the nearly vacant building, although an office wall was badly damaged.  Omega 7, a group of militant Cuban exiles, claimed responsibility.  A caller to radio WINZ said the bomb was in retaliation for the Venezuelan government's treatment of Orlando Bosch, an anti-Castro militant who has been jailed in Venezuela for six years.
SWITZERLAND.  Terrorists calling themselves anti-Communist revolutionaries seized the Polish Embassy in Bern and held 13 diplomatic hostages.  The group's leader, who identified himself as Colonel Wysocki of the Polish Revolutionary Home Army, threatened to bomb and completely destroy the embassy and everyone in it unless martial law was abolished in Poland, all political prisoners were released, all prison camps in Poland were shut down, and repression against the Polish people was halted.  He told police that they had 55 pounds of explosives in the embassy and gave the Warsaw government 48 hours to comply with their demands.  After the siege had gone on for 24 hours, the gunmen freed three persons including a pregnant woman. Five more hostages were released the following day at which time the terrorists also delayed the deadline until Friday the 10th.  A ninth hostage escaped.On Thursday the 9th, Swiss police stormed the embassy after laying out barbed wire around the rear of the building.  Tear gas was used, apparently hidden in a box of food passed into the building.  When it exploded, the police rushed the building.  Eventually the five hostages were released and the terrorists were captured and arrested.  The gunmen had demanded a car and safe passage out of the country, which had been refused by the Swiss government.  Earlier, a diplomat who had hidden in the attic was rescued through a top-floor window after police scaled the building.In November, Switzerland rejected a request from Poland for the extradition of the four men, stating that they themselves intended to try the men in 1983 in their highest court.  The four men are Florian Kruszyk, 42, Krystof Wasilewski, 33, Miroslaw Plewinski, 23, and Marck Michalski, 20.
ITALY.  It is not known if the Red Brigades or related far-left groups were behind the minor explosion in Rome which damaged the offices of SIMA, an international airlines agency which books cargo shipments for several airlines.  The attack may have been related to Arab terrorist organizations which are known to be targeting Rome for future attacks.
FRANCE.  Terrorists booby-trapped a car with Israeli diplomatic license plates, seriously injuring an official of the Israeli arms procurement mission in Paris.  Three other people were also seriously injured, and more than 44 others were injured from flying glass, including school children attending a school nearby.  Diplomat Amos Man-El, Zoltan Mandel-Schmidt, and his wife, Veronica, were badly injured.  There have been over 20 terrorist attacks in Paris against Israel, Palestine Liberation Organization, Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, and American targets in the last month.  The Armed Factions of the Lebanese Revolution took responsibility for the bombing.
HONDURAS.  Approximately 10 guerrillas of the Cinchonero National Liberation Movement, which is closely linked to leftist rebels in neighboring El Salvador, stormed the Chamber of Commerce building, taking 105 people hostage.  Twenty were released and three escaped.  The hostages included two Cabinet ministers and about 80 of the country's top business leaders.  Although their hostages include members of the richest families in the country, all the terrorists' known demands are political rather than monetary.  The guerrillas demanded the release of about 60 Salvadoran, Honduran, and other Latin American leftist activists believed to be in jail or to have disappeared after being detained by government forces during the last two years, as well as the removal of U.S. military advisers based here.  In addition, they asked that Honduras be withdrawn from the newly formed anticommunist Central American Democratic Community and that an antiterrorist law be repealed.  The spark for the takeover appears to have been the reported arrest on August 22 of Salvadoran guerrilla commander Alejandro Montenegro.Officials stated that they were offering nothing but safe conduct in exchange for the safe release of the hostages.  On September 23, the guerrillas released 20 more hostages.  Finally on September 28, the hostages were all released and the guerrillas were flown to Havana.

LEBANON.  An Israeli Army bus transporting soldiers back to Israel on leave was ambushed in the town of Alayh (close to Beirut).  The attack, carried out with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and machine guns, left six Israelis dead and 11 wounded.  It is believed that the operations are being carried out by terrorist teams penetrating Israeli occupied areas from Syrian-controlled Al-Bika valley.  A spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) stated that his organization is going to confront any Israeli move on the Al-Bika valley.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  A high-powered explosive device was discovered concealed in a fire extinguisher in the basement of a 25-story U.S. military apartment building.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  About 3,000 residents, most of them Americans, were evacuated from a 26-story apartment building in Eschborn while experts destroyed a time fuse set to trigger a 12-pound bomb in the building's basement garage.  Residents alerted the U.S. military police after they discovered wires protruding from a fire extinguisher packed in a plastic bag near the cars parked next to the building's main gas pipes.  The bomb was homemade.  No one claimed responsibility, but German militants were suspected.
SOUTH KOREA.  A homemade explosive was tossed onto the roof of the American Cultural Center in Kwangju in an unsuccessful attack on the U.S. facility.  No damage was reported.

The attack lasted about 20 minutes.
GUATEMALA.  The 33-year old physician daughter of Honduran President Roberto Suazo Cordova, was kidnapped by leftist guerrillas as she was leaving the hospital in Guatemala City where she worked.  The kidnappers demanded the publication of a political manifesto in Mexican and Central American newspapers.  Dr.  Xiomara Suazo Estrada was a Guatemalan citizen and has lived in that country for 20 years.  The kidnappers warned that her life would be in danger unless the Guatemalan government published the manifesto by 8:30pm on December 17.  The guerrillas did not identify themselves for tactical reasons.  Armed military patrols searched buildings and vehicles in the capital's streets but security officials said they found no clues to the whereabouts of the kidnapped doctor.  The Guatemalan government stood by its policy of not negotiating with terrorists, and the deadline for the publication of the group's manifesto passed.  In a final communique from the kidnappers the deadline was extended.  Finally, on December 22, fourteen Guatemalan, Mexican and Central American newspapers printed the guerrilla manifesto.  The message from the kidnappers identified them as members of the Pedro Dias Command of the Ixim (Mayan word for food) People's Revolutionary Movement.  They included the I.D. card of Dr.  Suazo.  On December 23, at sundown, after their only demand had been granted, the guerrillas released the woman, unharmed.  The published communique condemned U.S. imperialism in Central America.Dr. Suazo told reporters that she had been treated well and kept alone in a small room.  She had been injected with a drug when she was first seized.  Her captors remained masked throughout the nine-day ordeal and provided her with Communist literature to read.
UNITED STATES.  A powerful bomb damaged a suburban IBM office building during the evening, just four hours after a bomb caused extensive damage to a South African transport office on Long Island.  An anonymous caller told an editor of a White Plains newspaper that both actions were related, but declined to give an indication of what, if any, group instigated the bombings.  A call before the IBM bombing warned that a huge bomb would go off in 30 minutes, saying We did South African Airways. The call was repeated in five minutes and the bomb exploded at 7:40pm.  Damage to the building was extensive, but all personnel had been evacuated in time. IBM, which has extensive operations in South Africa, has been a leading target of groups critical of U.S. investments in South Africa.The earlier Long Island blast took place at the South African Railways Procurement Office.  Police said the bomb went off only minutes after the four-story building was evacuated and after a bomb squad threw a blast blanket over the device to contain the explosion.
LEBANON.  Italian soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force found two time bombs made from anti-tank mines in two U.N. schools for Palestinian refugees.  The fuse on one of the bombs had gone off but failed to detonate the explosive charge.  It was set to go off just before school started.  The sound of the fuse drew attention to the device, and guards from a nearby Italian guardpost were summoned.  The second bomb of similar construction was found in a stairwell of a nearby U.N. school after a search.
LEBANON.  Minas Bedros Simonian, an Armenian youth, was killed in an assassination attempt attributed to agents of Turkey, according to the London branch of the Armenian Popular Movement for the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA).

NETHERLANDS.  An attack against the French Consulate in Amsterdam seriously damaged the building but resulted in no casualties.  The action was claimed by someone in the name of the Dutch Militant Autonomous Front.  It was supposedly meant as a protest against French participation in European defense and the arms race.

The explosion was very powerful, causing serious damage to the Saudi official vehicle and wounding the First Secretary, his driver and two others.  People's Revolutionary Solidarity Organization (PRSO) claimed credit for the explosion.  Since a group using a similar name, People's Revolutionary Struggle, has claimed previous bombings in recent months against the U.S. Embassy, this group sent a xeroxed copy of the booby-trapped car's rental agreement.  The group accused Saudi Arabia of being agents of North American imperialism, supporting the criminals of the Turkish military state and financing the Zionists of the Israeli Army.
LEBANON.  A powerful bomb shattered the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, killing at least 57 people (17 of them Americans) and wounding at least 100.  A car filled with 200-500 pounds of dynamite rammed the front of the embassy, resulting in the blast, killing the driver as well.  The Islamic Jihad Organization (Islamic Holy War), a pro-Iranian group, immediately claimed responsibility; however, two other groups also claimed responsibility for the blast. There are indications, but no proof, that Jihad is linked with the Islamic Amal force, breakaway members of the Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem force in Lebanon.  The Islamic Amal force is based in and around Baalbek, a Lebanese town under Syrian control 45 miles east of Beirut where several hundred Iranian Revolutionary Guards have taken up residence.  Last month, a large wall inscription in central Baalbek, near posters of Khomeini, proclaimed, Death to the Americans, death to Israel, death to the Russians.

There were no casualties.  A phone caller said that the bombs were a response to oppressive elements in Syria and Lebanon.  A group called The Army for Iran's National Liberation also claimed responsibility for the bomb saying they placed the bombs to punish Khomeyni's allies.
EL SALVADOR.  Lt. Commander Albert Schaufelberger was the first American U.S. military advisor to die in El Salvador.  He was killed  by a two-man assassination team as he sat in his car in a parking lot across from the Central American University.  He was waiting to pick up a friend who works as a receptionist at the University.  According to witnesses, Schaufelberger was talking on or listening to his vehicle radio when a blue van pulled up next to the car.  Two young men, approximately 25 years of age, descended from the van and walked unhurriedly toward the U.S. officer's car.  Reaching it, one of the two thrust a pistol through the car vent wing window and shot Schaufelberger in the head and chest.  Not long after the incident, Radio Venceremos (the official transmitter of the guerrilla's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN]) broadcast the following message:  One of our units in the metropolitan command, the Clara Elizabeth Ramirez commando, assassinated on 25 May the second in command of the North American military advisors.  We advise the other North American advisors that El Salvador will become a Yankee tomb.  Another broadcast subsequent to the shooting indicated the operation was carried out by members of the Popular Liberation Forces (FPL), one of the several groups comprising the FMLN.
PERU.  Sendero Luminoso launched an incursion into the nation's capital of Lima.  At 6:20pm, during the middle of the evening rush hour, the entire city was blacked out for one hour by coordinated bombings which knocked down ten high tension pylons.  In the ensuring darkness and confusion, SL units positioned in Lima proceeded to detonate some 40 bombs, targeting, among other things, offices near the U.S. Embassy, the Sheraton Hotel and the Bayer Chemical Corporation's main industrial plant.  The Bayer factory complex (which is a West German firm) that produces acrylic fiber is reported to be the single largest industrial operation in Peru.  An estimated $300 million in damages resulted from fires which largely gutted the plant following the explosion of several incendiary devices within the complex.  It is significant to note that in a similar attack last year, when SL cut high tension electrical lines before proceeding with a wave of bombings against government and corporate installations within Lima, the offices of Bayer and other chemical companies were targets.
LEBANON.  Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas ambushed two Israeli military vehicles in the Shouf Mountains of Lebanon, killing two soldiers and wounding three others.

Bomb experts successfully dismantled the bomb minutes before it would have exploded. The Libyan Arab Airways jet was hijacked shortly after the takeoff from Athens and the ordeal continued for some 20 hours.  The two hijackers, who had demanded to be flown to Tehran, were identified as Radja Aref Akmed, 19, and Hasan Mahti Saadoun Hajj, 17.  One of the hijackers was brandishing a pistol in the air.  The hijackers are believed to be Lebanese Shiite Moslems searching for their missing religious leader, Imam Musa Sadr who disappeared in Libya in August 1978.  Followers of Sadr have carried out seven hijackings since his disappearance.  The two claim to be members of the Black Berets.
CHAD.  The leader of the rebels in northern Chad said that he was holding an American, Mark Frohardt, 32 years old, of Colorado Springs, Colo., and said he was a spy for the CIA.

At 9 p.m. two youths on a motorbike sped past the U.S.  Naval Base at Yokosuka and hurled two Molotov cocktails at the gate.  At approximately the same time, a fire on the Yokota U.S.  Air Force Base grounds was linked to the burned remains of a knapsack containing an incendiary bomb with a timing device.  Another small firebomb was discovered at the U.S.  Army camp at Zama.  All three bases are about 30 miles from Tokyo.(see 11/1/1983)

Mr. Garbidjian said that he gave a suitcase containing the bomb to a passenger on a flight scheduled to take off for Istanbul.  He told the passenger he had too much luggage and paid him about $65 to check the bag for him.  The bomb was supposed to have gone off once the plane had taken off.  Instead, it exploded as the suitcase made its way up a baggage ramp.

The M-19 cell that took him identified itself as the Julio Pena squad of the William de Jesus Parra group.
ETHIOPIA.  Ten Swiss citizens working for an aid organization were kidnapped by guerrillas. Four women and six men were seized near Jari where the aid group Terre des Hommes (Land of Man) operates a village for orphans.

FRANCE.  The former Iranian Chief of Staff of the late Shah of Iran's regime, Gholam Ali Oveissi, was shot down on a fashionable street in Paris.  The Butcher of Iran was shot in the back of the head and died instantly.  Also executed was his brother, a former army colonel.  Oveissi was considered responsible for the September 8, 1978 massacre  when troops fired into an anti-Shah crowd killing and wounding several demonstrators.

The Fighting Communist Party (linked to the Red Brigades) claimed credit, denouncing the Sinai Pact and demanding that the U.S. get out of Lebanon, Italy get out of NATO and that there be no U.S. nuclear missiles deployed in Sicily.  LARF (Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction) also claimed credit from Lebanon.  The description of the individual who fired the AK-47 rifle which killed hunt fits that of an Arab or Middle Eastern type.  This may have been a joint operation mounted with remnants of the Red Brigades that are in desperate need of outside support to revive guerrilla operations in Italy.
LIBYA.  Jordan has claimed that demonstrators set fire to its embassy in Tripoli, and that Libyan police watched without trying to stop the mob. Jordan has accused Libyan authorities of transporting between 200 to 250 Chadian mercenaries and workers, Libyan police and security men and Qaddafi's female bodyguards to the Jordanian Embassy to burn it down.  They say that 100 Libyan security men at the embassy participated in ransacking it and threatened to kill Ambassador Sami Shamayleh and his staff, who had locked themselves in one of the rooms.

The three story building located near Madrid collapsed.  Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. A Palestinian group called Wa'd, meaning promise, also claimed responsibility for the attack.  According to a Spanish weekly, Cambio 16, Spanish police reportedly identified two Palestinians who were involved in the bombing of the restaurant.  They had entered Spain carrying false passports a few days before the explosion and rented an apartment in the vicinity of Madrid.  Another Palestinian, carrying a forged Moroccan passport, was arrested in Frankfurt Airport on 2/19/85 with 10 kg of explosive charges.  He told his investigators that he had been told to transfer the explosives to Madrid where they would be used in order to attack American interests.
UNITED KINGDOM.  In the most blatant act of Libyan state-sponsored terrorism ever recorded in Europe, a Qadhafi-ordered hit man, who had recently been assigned to the Libyan Embassy in London, fired a submachine gun into a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered outside the mission building in St. James Square.  Several anti-Qadhafi protestors were wounded and a British policewoman was killed.  A crisis followed in which the British laid siege to the Libyan Embassy in London while the Libyans retaliated by taking similar action against the British Embassy in Tripoli.  Both governments finally broke diplomatic relations and withdrew their respective representatives following brief negotiations.  Upon entering the abandoned embassy in London, following the departure of the Libyan representatives, British authorities uncovered traces of the arms cache which had been kept at the installation.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.  The Guardsmen of Islam claimed responsibility for hijacking an Air France 737 jet to Tehran.  The group demanded the release of five Iranians being held in France for an assassination attempt on former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar in Paris in 1980.  The hijackers managed to smuggle a small quantity of plastic explosives onto the aircraft in Frankfurt with which they threatened to blow it up unless the pilot shifted course towards the Middle East.  In Tehran automatic weapons, ammunition and grenades were brought on board for the hijackers for withstanding any rescue attempt to recover the aircraft.  Negotiations between the French and Iranian governments prevented a major tragedy. The terrorists released the hostages on August 1, limiting themselves to blowing up the cockpit of the aircraft as a protest for their demands not being met.  Apparently there was at least some local backing from official sources in Iran in carrying out this incident.

The suspected terrorist leader escaped unharmed. More than 80 people were killed and 200 injured in the attack.  The U.S. has been accused of involvement, although CIA personnel had no contact with those who actually carried out the bombing. Apparently in late 1984 President Reagan approved a covert operation directing the CIA to train and support several counterterrorist units for strikes against suspected terrorists before they could attack U.S. facilities in the Middle East.  About four months later, members of one of those units, composed in part of Lebanese intelligence personnel, acted without CIA approval on an unauthorized mission.

They then escaped, disappearing into the Shiite-controlled territory around the airport.On September 13 1987, Fawaz Younis, believed to have been the leader of the terrorist cell involved in this hijacking (and also thought to have been involved in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA Boeing 727 en-route from Athens to Rome in which a U.S. serviceman was killed - see incident 4209) was lured onto a yacht by the FBI.  He is currently awaiting trial in the U.S.  Shiite Moslems have threatened attacks against U.S. interests if Younis is not freed.In February 1988 a U.S. District Judge ruled that Younis could be charged with leading the hijacking, but that he could not be prosecuted for allegedly assaulting passengers and blowing up the Jordanian Airline jet. The judge did not dismiss six conspiracy and hijacking counts of the indictment and upheld the use of Navy vessels that transported Younis after his arrest aboard the FBI-chartered yacht in the Mediterranean.  Younis claims that Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri approved the hijacking.On March 14, 1989, Younis became the first person convicted of criminal charges under provisions of a 1984 law that makes holding Americans hostage anywhere in the world a crime.  While being convicted of air piracy and the seizure of hostages, Younis was found innocent of charges that he helped destroy the aircraft.In October, 1989, Fawaz Younis was sentenced to 30 years for the hijacking.

Ten terrorists dressed in military attire attacked the cafe, leaving a communique indicating that their primary target had been the Marines.In 1988 a military appeals court ordered three suspected participants in this slaying freed under El Salvador's sweeping amnesty law that was adopted to conform with a regional peace plan.  Strong U.S. protest over this ruling resulted in the suspects being held while the government seeks an appeal.In May, 1991, a Salvadoran military court sentenced three alleged leftist rebels to prison terms ranging from four to 25 years for the killings.A report in May 1997 indicated that one of the men accused of the attack was living in the United States.

GREECE.  An Egyptian jetliner carrying more than 100 people on a flight from Athens to Cairo was hijacked by terrorists who originally identified themselves as members of Egypt Revolution.  Ten minutes out of Athens, the hijackers began frisking the passengers and collecting passports.  During the passport check, one of the terrorists came across an Egyptian security guard who pulled out a gun and killed the terrorist.  A gunfight between the other terrorists and the security guard ensued, and the guard was killed.  The gunfight depressurized the plane, which was forced to land in Malta.  The airport landing lights had been turned off.  Tension built steadily once the plane was on the ground, and the terrorists began systematically shooting passengers.  An Israeli girl, selected by her passport, was the first to be taken to the plane's platform and killed. Five minutes later, another Israeli girl was shot; she remains brain dead. Three Americans were selected after that.  One of them was killed and two of them survived, although the hijackers believed them to be dead. With the permission of the Maltese government, an Egyptian anti-terrorist unit stormed the plane in a lightning assault.  The terrorists threw three phosphorus grenades in the front and rear of the plane, which started large fires and spread burning shrapnel.  In all, sixty people were killed, including four of the hijackers.  One of the hijackers survived the attack, although he remains in critical condition. The action was later claimed by the Palestinian guerrilla group headed by Abu Nidal.  Egypt is accusing the Libyan government of direct involvement in the attack.  One of the hijackers, Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq, a Palestinian from Lebanon, was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison in Malta.  He was released after seven years due to pressure from Libya and went to Ghana, where he was held in custody.  With the cooperation of Ghana and Nigeria, the FBI arrested him in Nigeria in July 1993.

JAPAN.  Simultaneous rocket attacks were launched against the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and the Imperial Palace.  There were no damages or injuries reported in the attacks in which at least one incendiary device landed on the palace grounds while the Emperor Hirohito was inside and another ricocheted off a window at the embassy.  The attacks occurred at a time when security had already been tightened in preparation for the May 4-6 annual economic summit of seven world leaders, including President Reagan. While there were no immediate claims of responsibility, authorities speculate that the attacks were made by leftist radicals who had vowed to disrupt the summit and a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the emperor's reign.  Five explosive devices--seven-inch-long aerosol hair spray cans filled with flammable liquid--were fired from compact cars found parked on streets outside the embassy and palace grounds.  None of the devices exploded.  The facilities are about a half mile apart in the center of the city.

Two of the fatalities were U.S. soldiers, the other was a Turkish woman.  63 of those injured were Americans.  The Anti-American Arab Liberation Front, the Red Army Faction and an offshoot of the RAF, the Holger Meins Commando, all claimed responsibility for the blast.  Evidence of direct-Libyan sponsorship of this incident led to the U.S. bombing retaliation of April 14.

Anonymous telephone callers in London and Paris claimed responsibility on behalf of a group called the Anti-Imperialist International Brigades.  This group is believed by authorities in Tokyo to be a unit of the Japanese Red Army.  The action was linked to the recent seven-nation summit in Tokyo.  There is speculation the attacks were perpetrated by a small extremist group with the possible support of Libya.  The police arrested a Japanese man as he tried to flee the hotel from which the rocket was fired at the Japanese Embassy.  Reportedly three Libyans who had been seen with this man are being sought.

This is one of five simultaneous attacks in which forty-three people were killed and more than one hundred wounded:  The attack took place at Casa de Espana, a Spanish restaurant popular among Western tourists and Moroccans alike.  The attack was the bloodiest of the five, killing twenty, with eight European tourists among them.  It is unclear whether the attack was the work of a local al-Qaeda cell, or a home-grown attack perpetrated by one of Morocco's smaller fundamentalist splinter groups.  Moroccan authorities believe al-Qaeda financed the attack with US$50,000.  However, the alleged liaison between al-Qaeda and the Moroccan cell died in custody shortly after being apprehended, further obscuring the relationship between al-Qaeda and the perpetrators of the attack.

A bomb exploded in the Dynamo stadium in the Chechen capital, Groznyy, killing the republic's president Akhmad Kadyrov. Kadyrov was elected last fall in what was considered by many to be a fraudulent vote. The explosion was caused by a bomb planted inside a concrete pillar and occurred at 10:35am during a parade and concert in Groznyy celebrating the 59th anniversary of the victory of Germany in World War 2. The blast tore a hole in the section designate for dignitaries. It was not clear if the explosion was specifically targeting Kadyrov or whether it would have occurred regardless of his presence, as he was not officially scheduled to be at this event.  Khussein Isayev, chairman of the Republic's state council, and Adlan Khasanov, a reported for Reuters, were also killed in the blast. Col. Gen. Valery Baranov, the commander of the Russian military in the northern Caucasus was gravely wounded. Although estimates of total casualties varied, at least ten people were killed and around fifty more injured. These numbers include many civilians and WW2 veterans who were also attending the celebrations.  Officials believe that the blast was detonated by remote control and was intentionally installed below the VIP section. The bomb may have been planted some time ago during the recent renovations to the stadium. Preliminary reports suggest that the bomb was equivalent to one ton of TNT. The location of the bomb made it impossible for existing equipment to detect.  The type of explosive appeared identical to the type used to blow up the military parade two years ago in the Dagestani city of Kaspiysk. Rescue workers prevented two other blasts in the stadium. They were able to defuse another landmine and an additional explosive device equipped with a timer set to go off 30 minutes after the first explosion.

The attack may have been intended to sow panic and disorder among the Chechen leadership. Initial investigations were focusing on the security staff at the stadium and the builders who took part in the renovations of the stadium. Investigators believe that insufficient training and organization of the security staff was faulted for allowing the attack to occur. Officials had detained at least five individuals for potential involvement in the attack, including Ibragim Musayev, who was also involved in the hostage-taking raid of the Dubrovka Theatre and the bomb attack near a McDonald's in Moscow. Investigators had also given a more specific list of suspects who were under investigation to the Russian Duma.
