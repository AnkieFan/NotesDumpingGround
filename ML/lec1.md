# Introduction

## Well-posed learning problems
+ T: Tasks
+ P: performance measure
+ E: experience

#### example
A hand-writing recognition learning problem
T = recognizing handwritten words within images
P = percent of words correctly classified
E = database of handwritten words with given classifications

## Definitions
+ inductive bias (learning bias)
  +  is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs
  +  E.g.: for linear model: Inductive bias = Y = a+bX
+ hypothesis space 
  + Hypothesis space is the set of all the possible legal hypothesis. 
  + Machine learning algorithm would determine the best possible (only one) which would best describe the target function or the outputs.
  + E.g.: A set of $a$ and $b$ of linear model
