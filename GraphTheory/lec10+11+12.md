# Garbage-Collection Problem
Given a connected edge-weighted graph G:
compute / find a closed walk that traverses every edge (at least once) and is shortest.
- Eulerian Tour is similar to our problem

## Theorem:
If G is eulerian, then any eulerian tour is a solution to our problem.

## Our solution
- Compute O -> The set of odd-degree vertices in G
- create an auxiliary (辅助的) complete graph H on vertices O, with edge weights $\overline{w}(x_ix_j) = $length of a shortest $x_ix_j-path$ in G
- compute a minimum-cost perfect matching M in H
- For every edge $xx' \in M$, dublicate in G every edge of A shortest $xx'-path$ in G
- The result in G graph is eulerian: compute an eulerian tour in the new graph
- This eulerian tour induces a solution to the garbage-collection problem.

# Vertex-Coloring and Edge-Coloring
## Vertx-coloring
+ a coloring of a graph G = (V,E) is an assignment $c: V \rightarrow IN$ such that $\forall uv \in E: c(u) \not = c(v)$
+ For $v \in V, c(v)$ is called the color of v
+ k-coloring, for $k \in IN$, is a coloring using k colors
+ Graph G is k-colorable, if there exists a k-coloring of G
+ chromatic **number** of G, X(G), is smallest $k \in N$ such that G is k-colorable

### How many colors do we need?
+ G is a clique: X(G) = n
+ G is an indepent set: X(G) = 1
+ A star: X(star) = 2
+ A cycle: X(cycle) = 2/3
+ A path: X(path) = 2
+ Bipartite graph G: X(G) = 2
+ A tree T: X(T) = 2 (T is bipartite)

### Theorem:
+ $\forall G, X(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 1$
+ $\forall$ vertices cover S, $X(G) \leq |S| +1$

## Edge-coloring
+ an edge-coloring is a function $c: E \rightarrow IN$ such that, $\forall e,e' \in E, if e \cap e' \not= \empty$, then $C(e) \not ={C(e')}$
+ k-edge-coloring, for $k \in IN$, is a coloring using k colors
+ Graph G is k-edge-colorable, if there exists a k-coloring of G
+ chromatic **index** of G, X'(G), is smallest $k \in N$ such that G is k-edge-colorable

### Theorem:
+ G is bipartite iff G has no odd-length cycle
+ G is bipartite iff X(G) = 2

# Coloring of Maps / Planar Graphs
coloring of maps = vertex coloring of graph G

## Theorem
+ 4-color therem:
  + Any map can be colored with at most 4 colors
