# Flow network
- directed graph $G = (V,E)$
- edge capacities $c(e) \in R^+, e \in E$ 容积
- source node $s \in V$
- target node $t \in V$
f(e)是流量，c(e)是容积

## Definations
### Flow (in a flow network) is:
$f: E \rightarrow R^+_0$ s.t.
- $\forall e \in E: 0 \leq f(e) \leq c(e)$
- $\forall v \not ={s,t}: f^{in}(v) = f^{out}(v)$

### outflow and inflow
For any set $X \in V$ and flow f, define:
$f^{out}(X) :=\sum_{e = (u,v)\in E, u\in X, v\notin X}f(e)$
$f^{in}(X) :=\sum_{e = (u,v)\in E, u\notin X, v\in X}f(e)$

### Value (or size) of a flow f is:
$val(f) := f^{out}(s)$

### Maximum Flow is a flow of maximum value

### Cut
A cut in a flow network is a pair (S,T) such that:
+ $S \subset V, s\in S, t\notin S$
+ $T = V \ S$ (and hence $s\notin T, t \in T$)

## Theorem
+  For any s-t cut(S, T), $f^{OUT}(S)-f^{IN}(S) = val(f)$
+ For any flow network, there exists a flow f such that:
    $val(f) = min_{cut(S,T)} cap(S,T)$
  + Also known as min-cut max-flow theorem

## Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
Residual: 残量：容量和流量之差
1. build a residual graph; initialize the residuals to capacities
2. While augument path can be found；
   1. Find an augmenting path (on the residual graph)
   2. Find the bottleneck capacity $x$ on the augmenting path
   3. Update the residuals. (residual <- residual <- $x$)
   4. Add a backward path (along the path, all edges have weights of $x$)
  
### Flow-augmenting path P
st-path ignoring the direction of edges such that
- every forward edge $e \in P$ has f(e) < c(e)
- Every backward edge $e \in P$ has f(e) > 0

### Worst-case time complexity
+ let $m$ be the number of edges
+ it takes $O(m)$ time to find a path in unweighted graph.
+ Thus, the per-iteration time complexity is $O(m)$
+ Let the **amount of max-flow** be $f$.
+ The worst-case time complexity is $O(f·m)$

### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
Similar with Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm but:
in step 2.1:  Find a **shortest** augmenting path (on the residual graph)
