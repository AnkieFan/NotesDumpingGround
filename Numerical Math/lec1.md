# Computer Arithmetic

## Computer arithmetic
+ Float numbers has small error

## Numbers and representations
+ Integer: decumal "42", binary $"101010_2"$
+ Real numbers: uncountable

### Decimal expansions of real numbers
+ Rational number: have *terminating* or *recurring* decimal expansions
  + Some numbers have 2 ***different*** but ***equal*** representations: 0.25 == 0.250000... == 0.24999999...
+ Irrational: $e$
+ Uncomputable: there's *no finite* description of the decimal expansion
+ Approximation (近似值) :
+ Decimal places: $pi$ = 3.14159 *(5 dp)*
  + Round ties away from zero 

### Significant figures (有效数字)
+ α = 0.007 297 352 57 (11dp,9sf)
+ Zero: Note that 0 has no significant figures!
+ UnitsThe number of significant figures isindependentof the unit used.
  + e.g. The density of gold is19.32 g cm−3 (4sf,2dp) = 19320 kg m−3 (4sf).
  
### Scientific notation (科学计数法)
+ Scientific NotationWrite a number as a value $±m × 10^e$
where $1 ≤ *m* < 10$ and *e* is an integer.
+ Mantissa: m
+ exponent: e
+ The length of the mantissa is the number of significant figures.
