# UM DKE/DACS year 1
## Period 4:
### Linear Algebra
I recommend listening to MIT's Linear Algebra course (18.065 by Gilbert Strang). You can learn from him in a week and pass this course with at least 8.
Notes: [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/LinearAlgebra/NotesFromMITCourse.pdf)

### Data Sturcture and Algorithm
  #### Code Assignments(Full marks):
  + [Lab 5: Graph & Graph Traversal](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/DSA/lab5/src)
  + [Lab 6: Greedy & String Pattern Matching](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/DSA/lab6/src)
  + [Minimum Spanning Tree but very stupid](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/DSA/MST/src)
  
## Period 5:
### Software Engineer:
Take it easy, Christof and Tom are really kind.  
  #### Notes for the exam: [Notes](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/SE)
  #### Group Assignments: [Assignments](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/SE/Assignments)

### Logic:
  Too many pictures and symbols for notes, so I only have these  
  1. [lecture 1](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Logic/lec1.md)
  2. [lecture 2: semantic tableaux](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Logic/Lec2.md)
  3. [lecture 3: natural deduction](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Logic/Lec3.md)
  4. [Lecture 8: PDL (for the exam)](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Logic/Lec8.md)
  
### Numerical Mathematics:
  These notes are only for getting marks in exam, not for understanding everything.
  Advice for exam: If you want pass, you only need to know how to put the numbers into the formulas on formula sheet. Don't have to understand why.
  1. [Topic1](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Numerical%20Math/Topic1.md)
  2. [Topic 2: ODE, including the answer model of Matlab question](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Numerical%20Math/Topic2.md)
  3. [Topic 3: Polynomial Interpolation](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Numerical%20Math/Topic3.md)
  4. [Topic 4:Differentiation and Integration](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/Numerical%20Math/Topic4.md)
  5. Just practice to use the formulas on formula sheet. Especially Legendre polynomials, Chebshev polynomials and Fourier Series, Discrete Fourier Transform.
  6. Just practice to use the formulas on formula sheet. Especially Iterative Methods and Eigenvalues.

# UM DKE/DACS year 2
## Period 1:
### Probability and Statistic
  Most important: [cheat sheet](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/blob/main/ProSta/cheatsheet.md)  
  If you only have 1 day to learn this course, just remember all in this cheat sheet and do some mock exams.

  Assignments: [Assignments](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/ProSta/assigns)  
  
### Graph Theory
  Notes can't help a lot tbh: [Useless notes](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/GraphTheory)  

## Period 2 (I was indeed lazy in this period, didn't do much in assignments):
### Reasoning Technique
  Notes: [Notes](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/RT)  
  Assignments: [Assignments](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/RT/assign)

  Assignments(didn't get many scores): [Assignments](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/SSA/assign)  

### Machine Learning:
  If you have enough time, please watch Machine Learning course from Andrew Ng in coursera. His lectures are super.  
  Notes: [Notes](https://github.com/AnkieFan/NotesDumpingGround/tree/main/ML)
