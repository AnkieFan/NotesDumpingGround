## Regions & AZ

### How to choose region:
+ **compliance**: data must in the region
+ **proximity**: reduce latency
+ **feature availability**: some region has no certain AWS services
+ **pricing**

### Availability Zones
+ Each region has many AZs (uaually 3, min 2, max 6)
+ each AZ is 1 or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
+ they are separate from each other for isolating from disasters
