# Simulation definitions

## Mathematical simulation

### The nature of computer simulation
+ Simulation: Using computer techniques to simulate a real-world facility or process
+ Model: Mathematical or logical representation of system behavior (numerically)

### Systems, Models, and Simulation
#### Systems
Collection of entities that act and interact together to the accomplishment to a logical end
+ Discrete
+ Continuous
#### Models
+ Static / Dynamic
  + static simulation model is a representation of a system at a particular time, or one that may be used to represent a system in which time simply plays no role; 
+ Deterministic / Stochastic
  + If a simulation model does not contain any probabilistic (i.e., random) components, it is called deterministic.
+ Continuous / Discrete
#### Simulation
+ Discrete time simulation
+ Discrete event simulation
+ Continuous simulation
  + Variables change continuously over time
  + Differential equations
  + Course mathematical modeling
  + Predator-prey models
+ Monte Carlo simulation

## Monte Carlo Simulation
用计算机进行多次模拟，将模拟结果用作预测
