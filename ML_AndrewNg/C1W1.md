## Supervised Learning
X     ->       Y
input -> output label
+ Learns from being given "right answers" (correct label)
+ X & Y mapping

### Regression problem
Any results 
+ Predict a **number**
+ **Infinitely** many possible outputs

### Classification problem
Only certain possible results
+ Predict **categories** (Non-numerical)
+ Find boundaries]

## Unsupervised Learning
