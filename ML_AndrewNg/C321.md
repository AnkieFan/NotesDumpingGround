# Course 3 Week 1: Unsupervised learning

## Clustering

### K-means algorithm
+ assign points to cluster centroids
+ find new cluster centroids

#### Implementation:
Repeat{
    &emsp;# assign points to cluster centroids
    &emsp;for i = 1 to m
    &emsp;$c^{(i)}$ := index (from 1 to $K$) of cluster
        &emsp;&emsp;centroid closest to $x^{(i)}$
    &emsp;# Move cluster centroid
    &emsp;for $k$=1 to $K$
        &emsp;&emsp;$\mu_k$ := averange(mean) of points assigned to cluster $k$
}
Distinct: $\min_k ||x^{(i)} - \mu_k||^2$
